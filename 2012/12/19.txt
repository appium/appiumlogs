[2012-12-19 10:19:18] toks: Hmm, so I've read from 2 places that NativeDriver was discontinued... :(
[2012-12-19 10:20:08] toks: (which would explain why it doesn't work for me)
[2012-12-19 10:20:16] toks: (...sorta)
[2012-12-19 10:20:35] lukeis: the google project is abandoned
[2012-12-19 10:20:52] lukeis: it lives on in forks ;)
