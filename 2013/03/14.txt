[2013-03-14 14:39:46] toks: er
[2013-03-14 14:40:06] toks: having trouble starting the github build
[2013-03-14 14:40:14] toks: but I know it's on my side
[2013-03-14 14:40:16] toks: hold on
[2013-03-14 14:41:20] toks: whatever... changing global install of appium
[2013-03-14 14:42:57] toks: hmmm
[2013-03-14 14:43:02] toks: didn't work!
[2013-03-14 14:44:15] toks: let's see... what else is different about standalone firefox
[2013-03-14 14:44:24] toks: location has the full url
[2013-03-14 14:47:50] toks: testing...
[2013-03-14 14:50:07] toks: hmm
[2013-03-14 14:51:40] toks: okay...err
[2013-03-14 14:51:53] toks: so changing the controller to give full path in Location worked
[2013-03-14 14:52:01] toks: and the 302
[2013-03-14 14:52:57] toks: now...
[2013-03-14 14:53:31] toks: erm
[2013-03-14 14:53:51] toks: so I need to figure out how to see the Referer for the createSession request
[2013-03-14 14:54:08] toks: because I had to patch in the location of where the request came from into the URL
[2013-03-14 14:54:19] toks: (manually)
[2013-03-14 14:54:49] toks: in my case, machine 1 was doing the driver=webdriver.Remote() .....and it was running selenium grid
[2013-03-14 14:55:21] toks: so I patched machne2(running appium) to reply create session with http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/session/<sessionid>
[2013-03-14 14:55:34] toks: when machine 1 got that back, localhost is its loopback
[2013-03-14 14:55:36] toks: so it worked
[2013-03-14 14:55:57] toks: what I really need is the src IP
[2013-03-14 14:56:35] toks: once I figure this out... I'll send a pull request
[2013-03-14 14:56:47] toks: then you'll reject it showing me how very wrong I was.
[2013-03-14 14:56:55] toks: and give me the proper solution ;)
