[2013-03-11 16:03:01] sassda1: its jlipps
[2013-03-11 16:03:12] jlipps: oh hi lmorrison
[2013-03-11 16:03:43] jlipps: toks: so you don't like the sliding pyramids?
[2013-03-11 16:03:53] jlipps: lmorrison: how can i help?
[2013-03-11 16:04:22] lmorrison: i wrote you an email about helping me get started with Appium
[2013-03-11 16:04:40] lmorrison: can we go to a private channel?
[2013-03-11 16:05:35] jlipps: sure thing

[2013-03-11 16:11:26] larryg: hey folks. newbie here. question for you all: why would my ipad app launch with the iphone simulator instead of the ipad simulator?

[2013-03-11 16:12:10] jcarr: hi larryg
[2013-03-11 16:12:31] jcarr: the simulator that it uses is determined by how the app is compiled
[2013-03-11 16:13:14] santiycr, joining. (#appium)
[2013-03-11 16:13:14] jcarr: so when you do your xcodebuild, you can add 'TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=2' for ipad, or 'TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1' for iphone
[2013-03-11 16:14:04] larryg: thanks jcarr. will double check that i've done that.
[2013-03-11 16:14:35] jcarr: no problem!
[2013-03-11 16:14:46] jcarr: an example would be something like this:
[2013-03-11 16:14:48] jcarr: xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator6.0 TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1
[2013-03-11 16:23:14] davidko, joining. (#appium)
[2013-03-11 16:25:22] jlipps: jcarr: you can set which device you want to launch on in desiredCaps now too
[2013-03-11 16:26:39] larryg: jlipps i haven't found an example of that. right now i just have browserName, platform, version, app
[2013-03-11 16:27:03] jlipps: set 'device' to be either 'iPhone Simulator' or 'iPad Simulator'
[2013-03-11 16:27:10] jlipps: and make sure you're running on appium/master
[2013-03-11 16:28:10] jcarr: jlipps: stop making things awesome so fast, I can't keep up!
[2013-03-11 16:30:02] larryg: 'device': 'iPad Simulator' worked for me. thx!
[2013-03-11 16:32:26] larryg: sfbrian does your experience in social news shed any light on my question?
[2013-03-11 16:33:43] sfbrian: larryg: which question
[2013-03-11 16:36:53] sfbrian: larryg: you should ask Noah B. He would know
