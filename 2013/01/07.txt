[2013-01-07 15:28:03] stackedsax: howdy all
[2013-01-07 15:28:07] jcarr: hey hey
[2013-01-07 15:28:33] stackedsax: not sure if I'll stay connected, since I'm around 10000' right now....
[2013-01-07 15:28:47] stackedsax: but, I rached out to Dominic Dary over the weekend
[2013-01-07 15:29:15] stackedsax: about an 'AppiumAndroidDriver' or whatever we want to refer to it as
[2013-01-07 15:29:39] stackedsax: I heard you, jcarr, are working on something similar?
[2013-01-07 15:30:41] stackedsax: and lukeis has plans in his brain for something, too
[2013-01-07 15:31:05] jcarr: well I haven't written any code yet
[2013-01-07 15:31:05] stackedsax: it sounded like Dominic had some POC together already
[2013-01-07 15:31:11] jcarr: hey, I'd like to see that
[2013-01-07 15:31:21] stackedsax: yeah, you want me to forward you his email?
[2013-01-07 15:31:35] jcarr: that would be great - jason at saucelabs dot com
[2013-01-07 15:31:40] stackedsax: I don't think the POC is ready to be seen — I don't think he's put it up on github or anything
[2013-01-07 15:31:49] stackedsax: sure — you too lukeis?
[2013-01-07 15:35:22] *lukeis tries to catch up'
[2013-01-07 15:35:44] stackedsax: I found your email in AUTHORS, luke
[2013-01-07 15:35:52] stackedsax: sent you the message
[2013-01-07 15:35:57] lukeis: my email is more tan just there :)
[2013-01-07 15:36:20] stackedsax: do you prefer a different email?
[2013-01-07 15:36:29] lukeis: nope, that works
[2013-01-07 15:36:33] stackedsax: cool
[2013-01-07 15:37:04] lukeis: and yes, definitely if you have something dominik sent you, i'd like to see
[2013-01-07 15:37:19] lukeis: hiya jcarr have a good holiday?
[2013-01-07 15:37:41] stackedsax: yep, sent already
[2013-01-07 15:38:13] jcarr: yes very good, thanks
[2013-01-07 15:41:21] stackedsax: it sounds promising: using JSON Wire protocol and he's implemented a bunch already
[2013-01-07 15:42:11] stackedsax: I couldn't watch the demo, though
[2013-01-07 15:42:16] stackedsax: plugin problems
[2013-01-07 15:44:37] stackedsax: anyway, we're heading down now, I'll probably lise connection soon
[2013-01-07 15:44:40] stackedsax: *lose
[2013-01-07 15:44:41] lukeis: just watched it, it be fast ;)
