[2013-01-17 09:01:00] lukeis: :note toks you should do this "To avoid a security dialog that can appear when launching your iOS app, you need to modify your /etc/authorization file. You can do this by settings the element following <allow-root> under <key>system.privilege.taskport</key> to <true/> or by running the supplied python script (at your own risk)"
[2013-01-17 09:01:30] lukeis: admc: ^ that was his problem yesterdayâ€¦ we should add that to the README :) /me will do it if no one else gets around to it
[2013-01-17 09:13:52] admc: that would be great if you could get it in there
[2013-01-17 09:14:35] lukeis: will do in the near futureâ€¦ balancing work and some selenium tasks to prep for 2.29

[2013-01-17 10:59:19] stackedsax: lukeis: I've heard toks muttering about appium being much slower than AppDriver â€” is that what you find as well?
[2013-01-17 11:00:36] lukeis: hugs/appium certainly isâ€¦ appium/appium is faster than hugs ;)   but i can imagine it still being slower than AppDriver
[2013-01-17 11:01:03] lukeis: appdriver makes you recompile your app though with an embedded http server
[2013-01-17 11:01:10] lukeis: appium does not ;)
[2013-01-17 11:01:34] *lukeis doesn't use appdriver for iOS'
[2013-01-17 11:01:38] stackedsax: hmm, I thought we're using appium/appium.
[2013-01-17 11:01:53] lukeis: looked like he just started last night?
[2013-01-17 11:01:57] stackedsax: we don't use appdriver for iOS eitherâ€¦. hoping to use appium
[2013-01-17 11:02:27] *lukeis looks forward to the time hack hitting appium ;)'
[2013-01-17 11:02:45] stackedsax: we were just noticing appdriver on android being rather snappy and appium on iOS not so much.
[2013-01-17 11:02:53] lukeis: which will make appium run 'faster' but will also make your system go into the future!
[2013-01-17 11:03:23] lukeis: i'd say that's a fair assessment of the current state
[2013-01-17 11:03:58] stackedsax: I had noticed some convos mentioning iOS's accessibility api only allowing messages at a certain rate, or somethingâ€¦ but I only glanced at what the issue was
[2013-01-17 11:05:23] stackedsax: so the time hack will speed up the iOS system so it allows commands to be run sooner?  Something like, 'if iOS only allows 1 message per second, we'll speed up how fast the seconds go by...'?
[2013-01-17 11:05:48] lukeis: yes
[2013-01-17 11:06:18] stackedsax: awesome.
[2013-01-17 11:06:24] lukeis: so after a test with 30 commands, you'll be 30 seconds in the future
[2013-01-17 11:06:34] lukeis: after a few suite runs, maybe a day ;)
[2013-01-17 11:09:07] stackedsax: and it's just not possible to override the rate at which commands are allowed?
[2013-01-17 11:09:24] stackedsax: the time thing is neat, I just wanted to ask the obvious question
[2013-01-17 11:09:39] lukeis: nopeâ€¦ it's an apple instruments thing
[2013-01-17 11:09:44] lukeis: they's be bitches
[2013-01-17 11:10:00] lukeis: :)

[2013-01-17 11:33:20] santiycr: lukeis:  we can have github do announcements for us
[2013-01-17 11:33:36] lukeis: we can? we should then
[2013-01-17 11:33:57] *lukeis looks at the github settings'

[2013-01-17 11:36:49] lukeis: :-D
[2013-01-17 11:36:58] lukeis: we'll see if it takes ;)

[2013-01-17 14:19:29] toks: hmm, appium iOS.... is there a back button call I can make?
[2013-01-17 14:19:41] toks: driver.back() gives 404
[2013-01-17 14:20:05] toks: (which I guess makes sense considering this is an app and not a browser)
[2013-01-17 14:20:28] jcarr: yeah that's not a valid design pattern according to apple so I doubt it will get implemented soon
[2013-01-17 14:20:53] jcarr: I'm not even sure what it would do. There's not a 'last view' command for UIAutomation
[2013-01-17 14:21:12] toks: ah, cool.... so that concept simply doesn't exist for iOS apps
[2013-01-17 14:21:33] jcarr: yeah there's no back button on an iphone :)
[2013-01-17 14:21:51] jcarr: there are apps which implement back buttons in the UI but then you would just tell appium to click that UI element
[2013-01-17 14:21:57] toks: how about this then.... is there an appium call for that circle button that's on most iOS devices? I think it's considered the "Home" button
[2013-01-17 14:25:51] jcarr: no
[2013-01-17 14:25:58] jcarr: there's a 'put app in background' command though
[2013-01-17 14:26:12] jcarr: UIAutomation doesn't support controlling the home screen so they don't implement home button function
