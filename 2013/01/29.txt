[2013-01-29 11:40:28] toks: yes
[2013-01-29 11:44:56] toks: okay...
[2013-01-29 11:45:15] toks: so... another issue, is that server.js is using the text of a TableCell as an ID
[2013-01-29 11:45:35] toks: so what ends up happening from webdriver for a click
[2013-01-29 11:45:40] toks: is an invalid URL

[2013-01-29 11:47:00] sourishkrout: right, this is a wd.js issue
[2013-01-29 11:47:16] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 11:47:16] sourishkrout: i'll had a similar problem
[2013-01-29 11:47:22] sourishkrout: with "???"
[2013-01-29 11:47:29] sourishkrout: it should encode this properly
[2013-01-29 11:47:30] toks: ah
[2013-01-29 11:47:45] sourishkrout: i'm also working on the issue you created

[2013-01-29 11:48:16] sourishkrout: calling the text method on the button should def not make the server crash :)

[2013-01-29 11:54:12] sourishkrout: toks: i just realize you aren't using wd.js. you're on python, right?
[2013-01-29 11:59:11] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 11:59:17] toks: oh yeah, I am =/
[2013-01-29 12:03:26] toks: personally, I think appium shouldn't use the text as the id of the object
[2013-01-29 12:04:03] sourishkrout: UIAutomation is the problem here
[2013-01-29 12:04:11] toks: :O
[2013-01-29 12:04:21] toks: This worked in the old appim
[2013-01-29 12:04:30] toks: from python
[2013-01-29 12:04:43] toks: I'll have to go back and check to see what it uses for an ID in this case

[2013-01-29 12:06:44] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 12:06:59] lukeis: the old appium generated an id for the element and kept a map of it to the real element IIRC
[2013-01-29 12:06:59] sourishkrout: if you set the accessibility label on the UI element in question you'll get proper ids
[2013-01-29 12:07:21] toks: ah
[2013-01-29 12:07:31] sourishkrout: that's true but that creates a huge problem once you want to look up an id but it's real app internal name/id
[2013-01-29 12:08:03] sourishkrout: i'm going to send a summary about this to the mailing list later today
[2013-01-29 12:08:41] sourishkrout: that'll hopefully clear things up for you and we can discuss this further

[2013-01-29 12:11:02] toks: also, it's possible to have 2 things with the same text
[2013-01-29 12:11:34] toks: so you'd end up with 2 things with the same ID
[2013-01-29 12:11:55] sourishkrout: the same text yes but in this case you can always put two distinct accessibility IDs on them
[2013-01-29 12:12:23] sourishkrout: let me summarize this and post it to the mailing list
[2013-01-29 12:12:24] toks: hmm

[2013-01-29 14:08:30] toks: in the selenium client driver code? ....or just ensure that server.js doesn't send non-encoded ids to clients?
[2013-01-29 14:09:36] toks: for the sole excuse of wanting to dive into nodejs, I'm going to change it in appium's response not to encode all ids before sending them back to client :p
[2013-01-29 14:09:51] toks: just for my special-needs :p
[2013-01-29 14:22:45] sourishkrout: you can try that. however, the name of the button is returned in the post's body
[2013-01-29 14:23:02] sourishkrout: the problem is that on its way back to the server the client sticks it in the get's URL
[2013-01-29 14:23:05] sourishkrout: which makes it invalid

[2013-01-29 15:03:46] toks: that looks a patch specific to webdriver.js
[2013-01-29 15:05:26] toks: IMHO, I think appium should be made to fit all the other webdrivers out there
[2013-01-29 15:05:48] toks: just my 2 cents... feel free to > /dev/null

[2013-01-29 15:15:36] lukeis: i believe this to be a bug in both selenium webdriver clients (python, java, ruby, c#) and appium. The spec says ( https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#elements  section 9) that "The IDs used to refer to different underlying DOM Elements must be unique within the session over the entire duration of the session"  <- thus the bug in appium… but webdriver says the ID should be a DOMString ( http://www.w3.
[2013-01-29 15:16:03] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 15:16:36] *lukeis likes that I can refer to the 'spec' for webdriver now ;)'

[2013-01-29 15:40:49] lukeis: jlipps: yeah… update the system date to 1 second in the future, to trick instruments out of the 1 second sleep they have
[2013-01-29 15:41:11] jlipps: is this something that instruments does on its own or something devs have to respect "or else"
[2013-01-29 15:41:23] jlipps: i'm asking because i've heard of this limitation but haven't run into any need to be aware of it
[2013-01-29 15:41:26] lukeis: instruments does it on it's own
[2013-01-29 15:41:32] jlipps: but perhaps it's just limiting our speed
[2013-01-29 15:41:57] jlipps: i see
[2013-01-29 15:41:59] lukeis: from what i heard / read, apple had some synchronization issue that was solved by 'thread.sleep(1)'
[2013-01-29 15:42:55] lukeis: my iOS team (some former apple guys) say the instruments team is extremely small for apple (like 2 guys)
[2013-01-29 15:46:31] jlipps: it certainly seems that way :-)
[2013-01-29 15:50:53] jlipps: well i hope they feel flattered by all our efforts
[2013-01-29 15:52:05] lukeis: hopefully they notice :) but usually if you tag apple's name out there in the interwebs someone there will read about it… they do care about their branding ;)

[2013-01-29 18:02:32] toks: now my next issue, is that there is a UIAPopup in our app that is dismissed by clicking on any random area outside of it.... but I have nothing to click on
[2013-01-29 18:03:03] toks: clicking on the text/buttons that are outside of the UIAPopup without dismissing it first, results in a crash
[2013-01-29 18:04:03] toks: it kinda make sense, since those buttons aren't really available until focus is away from the UIAPopup and brought back to the main window
[2013-01-29 18:04:19] toks: but how do I click on "nothing"
[2013-01-29 18:05:23] admc1: maybe flick the screen?
[2013-01-29 18:05:36] sourishkrout: maybe that's something which could be achieved by clicking on a coordinate
[2013-01-29 18:05:41] toks: can I do that from python webdriver?
[2013-01-29 18:05:41] admc1: yeah or that
[2013-01-29 18:06:09] *toks checks methods on webdriver object'
[2013-01-29 18:08:25] toks: hmm... I don't see anything like that
[2013-01-29 18:09:39] admc1: toks looks like you use moveto
[2013-01-29 18:09:45] admc1: then click without passing anything through
[2013-01-29 18:09:50] admc1: should click that the last coords of the moveto
[2013-01-29 18:10:05] toks: hmm
[2013-01-29 18:10:14] toks: what are you using that you have a "move_to" method?
[2013-01-29 18:10:42] admc1: im just saying, thats how it should probably work based on the JSON wire spec
[2013-01-29 18:11:12] toks: hmm
[2013-01-29 18:12:42] admc1: toks it looks like flickElement
[2013-01-29 18:12:55] admc1: can take a element ID and offsets to flick
[2013-01-29 18:13:15] admc1: you could give it your thingy in focus, plus x,y and have it flick next to it so that it looses focus
[2013-01-29 18:13:20] admc1: if im understanding your UI correctly
[2013-01-29 18:13:21] admc1, changing nick to admc.
[2013-01-29 18:13:57] toks: that's cool, but I don't have those methods in python-selenium
[2013-01-29 18:15:31] admc: python selenium doesn't have flick?
[2013-01-29 18:15:49] toks: I don't think so, but lemme double-check
[2013-01-29 18:16:35] admc: you should submit a pull request
[2013-01-29 18:16:38] admc: shouldn't be all that hard ;)
[2013-01-29 18:16:55] toks: hmm
[2013-01-29 18:17:13] toks: To who? should selenium be expected to support an Apple iOS event?
[2013-01-29 18:17:41] admc: well the client drivers should support the JSON wire protocol to it's completeness
[2013-01-29 18:18:07] toks: hmm, interesting

[2013-01-29 18:19:57] toks: what can I do here...
[2013-01-29 18:20:10] admc: if you get it working, santiycr can help you get it into the client driver
[2013-01-29 18:20:16] admc: into the repo
[2013-01-29 18:20:31] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 18:20:37] admc: or you could write your test in node.js  and use wd
[2013-01-29 18:20:55] admc: which has all the flicks
[2013-01-29 18:20:55] admc: https://github.com/admc/wd

[2013-01-29 18:22:59] toks: I can't find it
[2013-01-29 18:23:35] toks: in my code, I'm doing: from selenium import webdriver

[2013-01-29 18:24:34] santiycr: let me show you
