[2013-01-29 11:36:35] sourishkrout: jlipps: please merge ^^
[2013-01-29 11:37:02] sourishkrout: toks: are you using webdriver to run tests against appium?
[2013-01-29 11:40:28] toks: yes
[2013-01-29 11:44:56] toks: okay...
[2013-01-29 11:45:15] toks: so... another issue, is that server.js is using the text of a TableCell as an ID
[2013-01-29 11:45:35] toks: so what ends up happening from webdriver for a click
[2013-01-29 11:45:40] toks: is an invalid URL
[2013-01-29 11:45:46] toks: Using wireshark... I see...
[2013-01-29 11:46:37] toks: POST /wd/hub/session/cde12b1e-4879-b291-3c4bed8c16d7/element/Rackspace Cloud(US), auth.api.rackspace.com/click HTTP/1.1
[2013-01-29 11:46:44] toks: That URL can't work
[2013-01-29 11:47:00] sourishkrout: right, this is a wd.js issue
[2013-01-29 11:47:16] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 11:47:16] sourishkrout: i'll had a similar problem
[2013-01-29 11:47:22] sourishkrout: with "???"
[2013-01-29 11:47:29] sourishkrout: it should encode this properly
[2013-01-29 11:47:30] toks: ah
[2013-01-29 11:47:45] sourishkrout: i'm also working on the issue you created

[2013-01-29 11:47:51] toks: :)
[2013-01-29 11:48:01] sourishkrout: i'll have to think this issue through but will get back to you soonish
[2013-01-29 11:48:16] sourishkrout: calling the text method on the button should def not make the server crash :)
[2013-01-29 11:48:27] sourishkrout: thanks for raising this as an issue
[2013-01-29 11:48:46] sourishkrout: appium <3 feedback
[2013-01-29 11:50:17] toks: \o/
[2013-01-29 11:54:12] sourishkrout: toks: i just realize you aren't using wd.js. you're on python, right?
[2013-01-29 11:59:11] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 11:59:17] toks: oh yeah, I am =/
[2013-01-29 12:03:26] toks: personally, I think appium shouldn't use the text as the id of the object
[2013-01-29 12:04:03] sourishkrout: UIAutomation is the problem here
[2013-01-29 12:04:11] toks: :O
[2013-01-29 12:04:21] toks: This worked in the old appim
[2013-01-29 12:04:30] toks: from python
[2013-01-29 12:04:43] toks: I'll have to go back and check to see what it uses for an ID in this case

[2013-01-29 12:06:24] sourishkrout: well, appium-old doesn't support look up by name

[2013-01-29 12:06:44] toks: o.o
[2013-01-29 12:06:59] lukeis: the old appium generated an id for the element and kept a map of it to the real element IIRC
[2013-01-29 12:06:59] sourishkrout: if you set the accessibility label on the UI element in question you'll get proper ids
[2013-01-29 12:07:21] toks: ah
[2013-01-29 12:07:31] sourishkrout: that's true but that creates a huge problem once you want to look up an id but it's real app internal name/id
[2013-01-29 12:08:03] sourishkrout: i'm going to send a summary about this to the mailing list later today
[2013-01-29 12:08:41] sourishkrout: that'll hopefully clear things up for you and we can discuss this further

[2013-01-29 12:11:00] admc, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2013-01-29 12:11:02] toks: also, it's possible to have 2 things with the same text
[2013-01-29 12:11:34] toks: so you'd end up with 2 things with the same ID
[2013-01-29 12:11:55] sourishkrout: the same text yes but in this case you can always put two distinct accessibility IDs on them
[2013-01-29 12:12:23] sourishkrout: let me summarize this and post it to the mailing list
[2013-01-29 12:12:24] toks: hmm
[2013-01-29 12:12:29] toks: 'k
[2013-01-29 12:13:05] sourishkrout: i think once you see the big picture it'll help understand and we can also get everyone from the appium community involved
[2013-01-29 12:13:25] toks: o.o
