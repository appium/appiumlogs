[2013-02-19 11:47:00] davidko: are there any known issues with spaces or non-standard characters in the app name?
[2013-02-19 11:47:15] davidko: we have a test app called "Attendee Î².app"
[2013-02-19 11:47:24] toks: what
[2013-02-19 11:47:31] toks: why would you do that? :)
[2013-02-19 11:47:55] davidko: it's our test app that points to our QA environment
[2013-02-19 11:48:02] davidko: which we want to use for automation
[2013-02-19 11:48:09] davidko: info: [INST STDERR] 2013-02-19 11:35:36.663 instruments[40808:1603] -[NSAlert alertWithError:] called with nil NSError. A generic error message will be displayed, but the user deserves better.
[2013-02-19 11:48:25] toks: hmm
[2013-02-19 11:48:51] toks: try renaming the app to plain ASCII and see if that works? :)
[2013-02-19 11:49:18] davidko: i tried that, but instruments doesn't seem to like it
[2013-02-19 11:49:27] davidko: i can't start the simulator once i changed the name
[2013-02-19 11:49:58] toks: hmm
[2013-02-19 11:50:28] toks: I recommend then renaming the app and compile it with the plain-ascii name to see if that's the issue
[2013-02-19 11:52:18] davidko: k
[2013-02-19 12:14:29] davidko: @toks: Yea, once I renamed the app, it could connect, but the simulator doesn't work with the modified app name
[2013-02-19 12:14:52] davidko: and i'm told it's not trivial to change the name

[2013-02-19 16:55:43] santiycr: implicity_wait should make appium keep retrying for elements to appear if they are not there when you try to find them
[2013-02-19 16:55:58] toks: o.o
[2013-02-19 16:56:05] santiycr: right now, it just sets some instruments timeout, which is completely unrelated

[2013-02-19 16:56:26] toks: hmm
[2013-02-19 16:56:27] santiycr: :)
[2013-02-19 16:56:50] santiycr: easy test, set implicit wait to 30s, then try to find an unexisting element in the app
[2013-02-19 16:57:09] santiycr: if the command fails faster than 30s in, it proves what I say

[2013-02-19 16:58:52] toks: heh, agreed. implicit_wait is broken

[2013-02-19 16:59:16] santiycr: compared to explicit waits

[2013-02-19 16:59:47] sassda: +1 on this :D
[2013-02-19 16:59:50] santiycr: which is very hard to say, considering I'm a big python guy
[2013-02-19 17:00:13] sfbrian: santiycr: +1 implicit > explicit
[2013-02-19 17:00:23] santiycr: #2 in the Zen of python:  "Explicit is better than implicit."
[2013-02-19 17:00:27] santiycr: LOL :)

[2013-02-19 17:01:14] santiycr: but you know what, principles are made to be disagreed upon
[2013-02-19 17:01:56] sfbrian: rules are meant to be broken
[2013-02-19 17:02:02] toks: santiycr: I disagree!

[2013-02-19 17:14:15] mlai: also i've been using the WebDriverWait and it's pretty robust. Something like:
[2013-02-19 17:14:34] mlai: WebDriverWait(self.driver, 3).until(lambda x:
[2013-02-19 17:14:34] mlai:              x.find_element_by_name(locators["mymenu.button"]))
[2013-02-19 17:14:51] mlai:  from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
[2013-02-19 17:15:33] toks: apparently that violates a python zen thing :)
[2013-02-19 17:22:44] sfbrian: what's up mlai
[2013-02-19 17:23:21] mlai: hey hey sfbrian :) how was beerfesting
