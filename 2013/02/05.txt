[2013-02-05 10:31:21] toks: So...
[2013-02-05 10:32:12] toks: last episode, toks was wrestling with why he couldn't make appium start the iOS-Sim in iPhone mode, rather than iPad...
[2013-02-05 10:32:15] toks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9582926/launching-retina-simulator-from-xcodebuild-for-continuous-integration
[2013-02-05 10:32:48] toks: Based on that link, I would think my problems would be solved by: defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator "SimulateDevice" "iPhone"
[2013-02-05 10:33:32] toks: but still, Simulator starts in iPhone mode. Also, when it exits, it writes "iPad" back to that plist file
[2013-02-05 10:33:52] toks: Then I just deleted the file completely
[2013-02-05 10:34:13] toks: And that resulted in a borderless Simulator with buttons in the app I couldn't reach anymore
[2013-02-05 10:34:16] toks: o_O
[2013-02-05 10:35:29] toks: but yeah, this is all because I've been shown that our app has a different layout for iPhone and I won't have the issue of not being able to dismiss one of the UIA views
[2013-02-05 10:37:11] toks: and....

[2013-02-05 11:29:49] jcarr: so you were having trouble getting the iphone not ipad sim?
[2013-02-05 11:30:02] toks: ^_^
[2013-02-05 11:30:09] toks: true.dat
[2013-02-05 11:30:25] jcarr: what's happening is that instruments is detecting what the app is compiled for
[2013-02-05 11:30:32] jcarr: and launching the simulator a certain way
[2013-02-05 11:30:34] toks: O_o;;;;;
[2013-02-05 11:30:39] jcarr: universal apps will *always* launch in the ipad
[2013-02-05 11:30:44] jcarr: there is a worksaround though
[2013-02-05 11:30:47] toks: oooooohhhh
[2013-02-05 11:30:54] *toks is all ears'
[2013-02-05 11:30:59] toks: (eyes?)
[2013-02-05 11:31:11] jcarr: if you build the app with the xcodebuild utility and pass 'TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1' at the command line, you'll get an iphone only version of the app
[2013-02-05 11:31:20] toks: I tried that!
[2013-02-05 11:31:24] toks: oh wait
[2013-02-05 11:31:37] toks: yeah, I tried that... but.. maybe didn't spell it that way

[2013-02-05 11:36:33] jcarr: :D no problem
[2013-02-05 11:36:37] toks: how did you know it was TARGETED?
[2013-02-05 11:36:42] toks: I saw TARGET in docs
[2013-02-05 11:36:45] jcarr: lots and lots of trial and error
[2013-02-05 11:36:55] jcarr: appium docs or other docs?
[2013-02-05 11:37:07] toks: just random googlin'

[2013-02-05 11:38:42] jcarr: really most of these settings you can find by looking through the xcodebuild spew
[2013-02-05 11:38:55] toks: "spew"
[2013-02-05 11:38:57] toks: ? o.o
[2013-02-05 11:39:29] jcarr: the huge wall of text it outputs
