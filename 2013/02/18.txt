[2013-02-18 14:24:11] mlai: Hi folks.. I am able to build for a device target, and also launch my app (and appium) once it is already on my device. I'm just unsure of how to install my app onto a device. Is this documented somewhere?
[2013-02-18 14:24:53] mlai: i mean, is there a NON-manual way
[2013-02-18 14:37:01] toks: o.o
[2013-02-18 14:37:09] toks: ah
[2013-02-18 14:37:11] toks: yeah...

[2013-02-18 14:37:58] toks: ^_^
[2013-02-18 14:38:52] toks: I'm actually in the middle of the same kinda project; automating installs of apps into an iPad/iPhone in a closet somewhere and run automated tests https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12
[2013-02-18 14:39:52] mlai: can the iPhone configuration utility do the same?
[2013-02-18 14:40:05] toks: hmm
[2013-02-18 14:40:09] toks: maybe?
[2013-02-18 14:41:17] toks: Also, I'm about to look into this https://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap
[2013-02-18 14:41:49] mlai: oh.. funny, i did work before with fruitstrap
[2013-02-18 14:42:06] mlai: it did work, but i was using it with calabashâ€¦ maybe i should resurrect it
[2013-02-18 14:42:52] toks: :)
[2013-02-18 14:42:57] mlai: that's an idea. Thank you :) if you want pointers, lemme know
[2013-02-18 14:43:15] toks: I just might ^_^
[2013-02-18 14:43:24] toks: This one looks more maintainhttps://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap
[2013-02-18 14:43:30] toks: This one looks more maintained https://github.com/ghughes/fruitstrap
[2013-02-18 14:43:42] toks: The dev submitted a pull request 14 days ago
[2013-02-18 14:45:04] mlai: yeah, there were definitely a few potholes along the way
[2013-02-18 14:45:38] mlai: some of it due to the latest mountain lion having different directory structures.. hopefully the latest pull resolved that
[2013-02-18 14:46:10] toks: ah, indeed
[2013-02-18 14:50:22] mlai: i've been following the 'unprompted' fork.. i see he's recently made some commits. Even though his fork was 5 months old, it solved some issues I couldn't get around
