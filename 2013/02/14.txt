[2013-02-14 11:01:27] sp0cksbeard: might be slightly off-topic, but how do you configure appium to launch on startup on your CI boxes?
[2013-02-14 11:02:14] sp0cksbeard: i've been trying to launch it via "launchctl", but I've been running into appium not being able to launch the iPhone simulator
[2013-02-14 11:03:04] sassda: we've been having some pb on our side to launch the simulator headlessly
[2013-02-14 11:03:10] alexglow, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 11:03:59] sp0cksbeard: in our case it's not a headless box, and it seems to run fine if I start the simulator manually and then launch appium via the command-line (as opposed to via launchctl)
[2013-02-14 11:04:58] sp0cksbeard: also in my case there are a few space characters in the full path to the iphone simulator (i've also tried passing it via the "--app" option)
[2013-02-14 11:30:12] toks: -l launch
[2013-02-14 11:30:33] toks: node server.js -l launch.... will start the iOS app immediately

[2013-02-14 11:35:44] toks: oh... hmm
[2013-02-14 11:35:59] toks: so, appium doesn't work if there isn't a UI session going
[2013-02-14 11:36:34] toks: I tried running appium on a remote macmini, it would not start the simulator until I first VNC'ed into the box and logged in
[2013-02-14 11:37:06] sp0cksbeard: that's the setup i've here too
[2013-02-14 11:37:13] sp0cksbeard: i'm signed into the box via vnc
[2013-02-14 11:37:14] sp0cksbeard: i
[2013-02-14 11:37:15] sp0cksbeard: sup
[2013-02-14 11:37:34] sp0cksbeard: i suppose without logging in, the situation is the same as the headless one
[2013-02-14 11:40:48] toks: hmm
[2013-02-14 11:41:07] toks: what error do you get? It works for me
[2013-02-14 11:41:09] sourishkrout, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 11:41:23] toks: though linux's vnc doesn't repaint the iOS simulator window properly
[2013-02-14 11:41:31] toks: (but it is working)
[2013-02-14 11:53:59] sp0cksbeard: yesterday there was a discussion about how to send the return key to the keyboard. does anyone recall what's the right way to do this?
[2013-02-14 11:54:09] sp0cksbeard: I want to hit the enter button on my keyboard
[2013-02-14 11:55:41] sp0cksbeard: toks: any clues about the above? :-)
