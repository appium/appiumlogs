[2013-02-14 11:01:27] sp0cksbeard: might be slightly off-topic, but how do you configure appium to launch on startup on your CI boxes?
[2013-02-14 11:02:14] sp0cksbeard: i've been trying to launch it via "launchctl", but I've been running into appium not being able to launch the iPhone simulator
[2013-02-14 11:03:04] sassda: we've been having some pb on our side to launch the simulator headlessly
[2013-02-14 11:03:10] alexglow, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 11:03:59] sp0cksbeard: in our case it's not a headless box, and it seems to run fine if I start the simulator manually and then launch appium via the command-line (as opposed to via launchctl)
[2013-02-14 11:04:58] sp0cksbeard: also in my case there are a few space characters in the full path to the iphone simulator (i've also tried passing it via the "--app" option)

[2013-02-14 11:30:33] toks: node server.js -l launch.... will start the iOS app immediately

[2013-02-14 11:36:34] toks: I tried running appium on a remote macmini, it would not start the simulator until I first VNC'ed into the box and logged in
[2013-02-14 11:37:06] sp0cksbeard: that's the setup i've here too
[2013-02-14 11:37:13] sp0cksbeard: i'm signed into the box via vnc

[2013-02-14 11:37:15] sp0cksbeard: sup
[2013-02-14 11:37:34] sp0cksbeard: i suppose without logging in, the situation is the same as the headless one

I'd love to be able to try log gin in via Facebook, but it kicks off a web view to login. Could I create another appium connection to send requests to mobile safari, then wait for my app to foreground again?

[2013-02-14 13:37:38] berni1: ok

[2013-02-14 13:46:49] mlai_: berni1: okay, back :) short meeting.
[2013-02-14 13:47:15] berni1: cool, what's your problem then :-) ?
[2013-02-14 13:47:36] mlai_: earlier chat: question about transitions between native app views and web. Is it possible? I'd love to be able to try log gin in via Facebook, but it kicks off a web view to login. Could I create another appium connection to send requests to mobile safari, then wait for my app to foreground again?
[2013-02-14 13:48:20] berni1: well in fact it's pretty easy
[2013-02-14 13:48:46] berni1: you have to wait for Safari to go into foreground
[2013-02-14 13:49:06] berni1: and then get window handler (using wd.js you use function windowHandles() )
[2013-02-14 13:49:52] berni1: when you've got them you just switch to the 'safari' window (wd.js browser.window(handles[0]) )
[2013-02-14 13:50:09] berni1: then all your commands are sent to Safari
[2013-02-14 13:50:40] berni1: you can for example make some javascript calls there like browser.eval('document.querySelector("[name=login]").click();')
[2013-02-14 13:51:12] berni1: and when you're done jsut swtich back to app with (wd.js) browser.frame(null);
[2013-02-14 13:51:41] mlai_: interesting… okay.. i can give this a try. I'm writing in python but I'm guessing there are similar methods
[2013-02-14 13:51:42] berni1: are you using JavaScript webdriver or some other one?
[2013-02-14 13:52:30] berni1: yeah it's all compliant with JSON Wire protocol specification so they should be all the same
[2013-02-14 13:52:54] mlai_: looks like 'window_handles' does the same… http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/webdriver_remote/selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.html#selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.WebDriver.window_handles
[2013-02-14 13:53:22] berni1: yeah and than switch_to_window
[2013-02-14 13:53:39] berni1: should work :-)
[2013-02-14 13:54:39] mlai_: thank you for the help!
[2013-02-14 13:54:44] mlai_: sounds easy as pie.
[2013-02-14 13:54:54] berni1: yeah shouldn't be that hard
[2013-02-14 13:55:09] berni1: give it a try and let me know if you're stuck somewhere
[2013-02-14 13:59:00] toks: oh yea, so....
[2013-02-14 13:59:02] mlai_: berni1: would you happen to know the names of the 3 elements on the fb login page?
[2013-02-14 13:59:31] toks: o_O
[2013-02-14 13:59:41] berni1: sure
[2013-02-14 13:59:41] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=email]").value = "' + login.email + '";'
[2013-02-14 13:59:50] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=pass]").value = "' + login.password + '";'
[2013-02-14 13:59:57] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=login]").click();'
[2013-02-14 14:00:17] berni1: and on the next view there is a screen to auth the app
[2013-02-14 14:00:17] berni1: 'document.querySelector("button[type=submit]").click();'
[2013-02-14 14:00:18] berni1: ;-)
[2013-02-14 14:00:32] berni1: I mean button, not screen
[2013-02-14 14:00:59] toks: so.. driver.execute_script("mobile: tap",[{'x':2,'y':2}])
[2013-02-14 14:01:10] toks: doesn't work; the value are ignored
[2013-02-14 14:02:39] toks: anyone wanna confirm?
[2013-02-14 14:02:40] toks: actually
[2013-02-14 14:02:47] toks: I'm just gonna open an issue
[2013-02-14 14:02:52] berni1: toks: you probably want to do:
[2013-02-14 14:02:57] berni1: var tapOpts = {tapCount: 1 // how many taps
[2013-02-14 14:02:57] berni1: , duration: 0.1 // how long
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: , touchCount: 1 // how many fingers
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: , x: 123, y: 456
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: }
[2013-02-14 14:03:04] berni1: driver.execute("mobile: tap", [tapOpts]);
[2013-02-14 14:03:15] toks: I'm in python
[2013-02-14 14:03:17] toks: but yeah
[2013-02-14 14:03:25] toks: so you think I need to provide all values?
[2013-02-14 14:03:35] toks: lemme try
[2013-02-14 14:03:38] berni1: I'm not sure but you could give it a try
[2013-02-14 14:03:55] berni1: jlipps: does it default to some values if you don't provide them?
[2013-02-14 14:06:45] berni1: yeah in fact it looks that it should default to some values
[2013-02-14 14:08:14] berni1: toks: what's going on in appium console when you perform that command?
[2013-02-14 14:08:25] toks: hmm
[2013-02-14 14:08:38] toks: well, now I'm just getting some kind of syntax error
[2013-02-14 14:08:39] toks: hold
[2013-02-14 14:08:40] toks: on
