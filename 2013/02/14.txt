[2013-02-14 11:01:27] sp0cksbeard: might be slightly off-topic, but how do you configure appium to launch on startup on your CI boxes?
[2013-02-14 11:02:14] sp0cksbeard: i've been trying to launch it via "launchctl", but I've been running into appium not being able to launch the iPhone simulator
[2013-02-14 11:03:04] sassda: we've been having some pb on our side to launch the simulator headlessly
[2013-02-14 11:03:10] alexglow, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 11:03:59] sp0cksbeard: in our case it's not a headless box, and it seems to run fine if I start the simulator manually and then launch appium via the command-line (as opposed to via launchctl)
[2013-02-14 11:04:58] sp0cksbeard: also in my case there are a few space characters in the full path to the iphone simulator (i've also tried passing it via the "--app" option)

[2013-02-14 11:36:34] toks: I tried running appium on a remote macmini, it would not start the simulator until I first VNC'ed into the box and logged in

[2013-02-14 11:37:13] sp0cksbeard: i'm signed into the box via vnc

[2013-02-14 13:47:15] berni1: cool, what's your problem then :-) ?
[2013-02-14 13:47:36] mlai_: earlier chat: question about transitions between native app views and web. Is it possible? I'd love to be able to try log gin in via Facebook, but it kicks off a web view to login. Could I create another appium connection to send requests to mobile safari, then wait for my app to foreground again?
[2013-02-14 13:48:20] berni1: well in fact it's pretty easy
[2013-02-14 13:48:46] berni1: you have to wait for Safari to go into foreground
[2013-02-14 13:49:06] berni1: and then get window handler (using wd.js you use function windowHandles() )
[2013-02-14 13:49:52] berni1: when you've got them you just switch to the 'safari' window (wd.js browser.window(handles[0]) )
[2013-02-14 13:50:09] berni1: then all your commands are sent to Safari
[2013-02-14 13:50:40] berni1: you can for example make some javascript calls there like browser.eval('document.querySelector("[name=login]").click();')
[2013-02-14 13:51:12] berni1: and when you're done jsut swtich back to app with (wd.js) browser.frame(null);
[2013-02-14 13:51:41] mlai_: interesting… okay.. i can give this a try. I'm writing in python but I'm guessing there are similar methods
[2013-02-14 13:51:42] berni1: are you using JavaScript webdriver or some other one?
[2013-02-14 13:52:30] berni1: yeah it's all compliant with JSON Wire protocol specification so they should be all the same
[2013-02-14 13:52:54] mlai_: looks like 'window_handles' does the same… http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/webdriver_remote/selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.html#selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.WebDriver.window_handles
[2013-02-14 13:53:22] berni1: yeah and than switch_to_window
[2013-02-14 13:53:39] berni1: should work :-)
[2013-02-14 13:54:39] mlai_: thank you for the help!
[2013-02-14 13:54:44] mlai_: sounds easy as pie.
[2013-02-14 13:54:54] berni1: yeah shouldn't be that hard
[2013-02-14 13:55:09] berni1: give it a try and let me know if you're stuck somewhere
[2013-02-14 13:59:00] toks: oh yea, so....
[2013-02-14 13:59:02] mlai_: berni1: would you happen to know the names of the 3 elements on the fb login page?
[2013-02-14 13:59:31] toks: o_O
[2013-02-14 13:59:41] berni1: sure
[2013-02-14 13:59:41] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=email]").value = "' + login.email + '";'
[2013-02-14 13:59:50] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=pass]").value = "' + login.password + '";'
[2013-02-14 13:59:57] berni1: 'document.querySelector("[name=login]").click();'
[2013-02-14 14:00:17] berni1: and on the next view there is a screen to auth the app
[2013-02-14 14:00:17] berni1: 'document.querySelector("button[type=submit]").click();'
[2013-02-14 14:00:18] berni1: ;-)
[2013-02-14 14:00:32] berni1: I mean button, not screen
[2013-02-14 14:00:59] toks: so.. driver.execute_script("mobile: tap",[{'x':2,'y':2}])
[2013-02-14 14:01:10] toks: doesn't work; the value are ignored
[2013-02-14 14:02:39] toks: anyone wanna confirm?
[2013-02-14 14:02:40] toks: actually
[2013-02-14 14:02:47] toks: I'm just gonna open an issue
[2013-02-14 14:02:52] berni1: toks: you probably want to do:
[2013-02-14 14:02:57] berni1: var tapOpts = {tapCount: 1 // how many taps
[2013-02-14 14:02:57] berni1: , duration: 0.1 // how long
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: , touchCount: 1 // how many fingers
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: , x: 123, y: 456
[2013-02-14 14:02:58] berni1: }
[2013-02-14 14:03:04] berni1: driver.execute("mobile: tap", [tapOpts]);
[2013-02-14 14:03:15] toks: I'm in python
[2013-02-14 14:03:17] toks: but yeah
[2013-02-14 14:03:25] toks: so you think I need to provide all values?
[2013-02-14 14:03:35] toks: lemme try
[2013-02-14 14:03:38] berni1: I'm not sure but you could give it a try
[2013-02-14 14:03:55] berni1: jlipps: does it default to some values if you don't provide them?
[2013-02-14 14:06:45] berni1: yeah in fact it looks that it should default to some values
[2013-02-14 14:08:14] berni1: toks: what's going on in appium console when you perform that command?
[2013-02-14 14:08:25] toks: hmm
[2013-02-14 14:08:38] toks: well, now I'm just getting some kind of syntax error
[2013-02-14 14:08:39] toks: hold
[2013-02-14 14:08:40] toks: on
[2013-02-14 14:10:24] toks: okay, yeah
[2013-02-14 14:10:47] toks: no matter what I do, server.js logs says it got x:0.5,y:0.5
[2013-02-14 14:13:49] berni1: weird, works as expected with wd.js
[2013-02-14 14:13:54] alexglow, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 14:13:58] berni1: yeah create an issue for that
[2013-02-14 14:14:16] toks: ....what
[2013-02-14 14:14:20] toks: works in wd?
[2013-02-14 14:14:49] berni1: yeah in javascript implementation of webdriver:  https://github.com/admc/wd
[2013-02-14 14:14:57] toks: hmm
[2013-02-14 14:15:02] toks: do you have wireshark? :)
[2013-02-14 14:15:11] toks: I'd like to compare what goes over the wire :p
[2013-02-14 14:15:26] berni1: we're using it for writing tests for appium
[2013-02-14 14:15:32] berni1: nope, but I can download it ;-)
[2013-02-14 14:16:18] berni1: in fact you can even run them yourself I guess
[2013-02-14 14:16:25] berni1: as you've already got Appium
[2013-02-14 14:16:26] berni1: https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/test/functional/uicatalog/gestures.js
[2013-02-14 14:16:26] toks: oh yeah
[2013-02-14 14:17:40] berni1: what you need to do is:
[2013-02-14 14:17:43] toks: before I go too far into that, the only reason I needed mobile:tap was because the iOS app I'm testing has a confirmation button that slides onto the screen
[2013-02-14 14:17:57] toks: that button is not visible in driver.page_source it seems
[2013-02-14 14:18:28] berni1: yeah I had that problem too - and that's why I was using tap for that too ;-)
[2013-02-14 14:18:35] toks: ah
[2013-02-14 14:18:36] toks: :)
[2013-02-14 14:18:49] berni1: some UI elements are just not listed by UIAutomation
[2013-02-14 14:18:53] jlipps: toks, berni1 i think we have access to that confirmation button
[2013-02-14 14:19:01] toks: lies!
[2013-02-14 14:19:18] jlipps: i think it might be called the 'actionSheet'
[2013-02-14 14:19:22] toks: o_O
[2013-02-14 14:19:24] jlipps: similar to how alerts don't show up in the page source
[2013-02-14 14:19:26] *toks checks'
[2013-02-14 14:19:27] jlipps: but you can query them
[2013-02-14 14:19:32] berni1: ahh
[2013-02-14 14:19:34] jlipps: self.driver.find_element_by_tag_name('alert') works
[2013-02-14 14:19:54] jlipps: i wonder if self.driver.find_element_by_tag_name('actionsheet') works
[2013-02-14 14:20:07] jlipps: and then you can look for buttons from that context
[2013-02-14 14:20:16] toks: doesn't work for me
[2013-02-14 14:20:27] jlipps: ok
[2013-02-14 14:20:51] toks: it's a light grey, a bit transparent, overlay that slides up from the bottom
[2013-02-14 14:20:56] berni1: toks: if you want to run the 'gesture' tests that you wd.js you just need to: 1. run grunt appium:UICatalog in apium dir, and 2. run mocha -t 70000 -R spec test/functional/uicatalog/gestures.js in second console window
[2013-02-14 14:20:56] jlipps: what about UIAEditingMenu
[2013-02-14 14:21:15] berni1: *that use
[2013-02-14 14:21:20] jlipps: toks, try self.driver.find_element_by_tag_name('UIAEditingMenu')
[2013-02-14 14:21:40] toks: not found
[2013-02-14 14:23:09] mlai_: how about 'alertView'
[2013-02-14 14:23:55] toks: is that  a tag name?
[2013-02-14 14:24:00] mlai_: yes
[2013-02-14 14:24:07] toks: not found
[2013-02-14 14:25:39] mlai_: hmm, another try… self.driver.find_element_by_name('<title text of alert>')?
[2013-02-14 14:25:56] toks: it's not an alert
[2013-02-14 14:26:21] mlai_: oh- sorry, the button on the alert? is that what you're looking for?
[2013-02-14 14:26:41] toks: there's no alert on screen
[2013-02-14 14:26:46] toks: it's an overlay
[2013-02-14 14:27:19] jlipps: like the thing that slides up from the bottom that has delete/cancel/share via twitter type actions?
[2013-02-14 14:27:28] toks: indeed
[2013-02-14 14:27:33] jlipps: toks, if it's a custom control, it won't work at all

[2013-02-14 14:27:48] mlai_: ah. okay. #nohelp
[2013-02-14 14:27:58] jlipps: the "bit transparent" part makes me think it might be custom?
[2013-02-14 14:28:21] berni1: looking at UICatalog app in Alerts > UIActionSheet
[2013-02-14 14:28:31] berni1: it looks that it has a transparent bg too
[2013-02-14 14:29:00] jlipps: ok cool, so maybe it is the action sheet. are you trying to find it when it is displayeD?
[2013-02-14 14:29:12] jlipps: or maybe toks it is 'UIAActivityView'?
[2013-02-14 14:29:21] jlipps: or 'UIAActivityIndicator'? not sure what those are
[2013-02-14 14:29:26] *toks checks driver.page_source again...'
[2013-02-14 14:29:49] toks: it is none of those things, appium doesn't see it.
[2013-02-14 14:30:03] toks: I think I need to go back to mobile:tap
[2013-02-14 14:30:29] toks: since mobile:tap apparently works from wd.js, just not python... I will make a custom HTTP POST to make it work from my scripts
[2013-02-14 14:30:50] toks: after wireshark'ing what is sent by wd.js
[2013-02-14 14:31:04] sassda: why don't you use raw UIA command?
[2013-02-14 14:31:21] berni1: toks: how does the requests differ?
[2013-02-14 14:31:28] toks: checking
[2013-02-14 14:31:41] toks: I just know you said it works from wd.js, but it definitely doesn't work for me
[2013-02-14 14:31:44] toks: (in python)

[2013-02-14 14:40:47] toks: yeah...
[2013-02-14 14:40:58] toks: okay, server.js log shows the right thing from nodejs
[2013-02-14 14:41:02] toks: checking for diff
[2013-02-14 14:43:37] toks: lol

[2013-02-14 14:44:06] toks: so okay.... freakin' python
[2013-02-14 14:44:15] berni1: what's the thing?
[2013-02-14 14:44:32] toks: so, nodejs... driver.execute('mobile: tap',[{'x':0.9,'y':0.9}]);
[2013-02-14 14:44:43] toks: HTTP POST DATA = {"script":"mobile: tap","args":[{"x":0.9,"y":0.9}]}
[2013-02-14 14:45:04] toks: python ....driver.execute_script("mobile: tap",[{"x":0.9,"y":0.9}])
[2013-02-14 14:45:13] toks: {"sessionId": "4fd8ae87-7ed3-46f6-8d74-33639bfcdc01", "args": [[{"y": 0.90000000000000002, "x": 0.90000000000000002}]], "script": "mobile: tap"}
[2013-02-14 14:45:17] toks: o_O;;;;;;;;;;;
[2013-02-14 14:45:22] jlipps: lol
[2013-02-14 14:45:29] toks: stupid python
[2013-02-14 14:45:30] toks: well then
[2013-02-14 14:45:40] jlipps: try passing in a string
[2013-02-14 14:45:45] jlipps: i think i parse a float from it in appium server
[2013-02-14 14:45:50] jlipps: so like "0.9"
[2013-02-14 14:45:53] jlipps: might still work
[2013-02-14 14:45:56] *toks tries'
[2013-02-14 14:46:36] toks: python - d.execute_script("mobile: tap",[{"x":"0.9","y":"0.9"}])
[2013-02-14 14:46:46] toks: d.execute_script("mobile: tap",[{"x":"0.9","y":"0.9"}])
[2013-02-14 14:46:50] toks: so... the problem now is
[2013-02-14 14:46:53] toks: those double [[
[2013-02-14 14:47:11] toks: that's like an array within an array or something
[2013-02-14 14:47:25] toks: I bet appium can't find the data in there
[2013-02-14 14:48:22] toks: oh hey
[2013-02-14 14:48:29] toks: if I remove my []
[2013-02-14 14:48:34] toks: then it goes as normal
[2013-02-14 14:48:55] toks: okay, this works: execute_script("mobile: tap",{"x":"0.9","y":"0.9"})
[2013-02-14 14:48:56] toks: :)
[2013-02-14 14:49:01] toks: thanks for playing
[2013-02-14 14:49:03] toks: ^_^
[2013-02-14 14:49:32] toks: probably should have just wireshark'ed this from the beginning :)
[2013-02-14 14:53:20] toks: but now I know if something doesn't work, try it with wd.js first :)
[2013-02-14 14:53:38] toks: make sure python and wd.js are sending the same thing
[2013-02-14 14:54:39] jlipps: toks, i bet python has (script, *args)
[2013-02-14 14:54:43] jlipps: in the execute_script definition
[2013-02-14 14:55:01] jlipps: and then *args is just JSON'ed as args
[2013-02-14 14:55:35] jlipps: hey, toks, why don't you add this wonderful knowledge to https://github.com/appium/appium/wiki/Automating-mobile-gestures, kk? ^_^
[2013-02-14 14:56:50] toks: o.o

[2013-02-14 14:57:48] toks: oh
[2013-02-14 14:58:10] toks: so, I need to fork that repo and submit a pull request after modding that page?
[2013-02-14 14:58:35] jlipps: no, you can just modify wiki pages in place

Is there such a workaround for python?   File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py", line 159, in send_keys
[2013-02-14 15:30:24] mlai_:     self._execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ELEMENT, {'value': typing})
[2013-02-14 15:31:05] berni1: mlai_:  I believe you can use JS too
[2013-02-14 15:31:06] admc, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-14 15:31:27] jlipps: mlai_: self.execute
[2013-02-14 15:31:37] jlipps: not self._execute
[2013-02-14 15:31:41] jlipps: and typing may need to be an array
[2013-02-14 15:31:51] berni1: like driver.execute_script('document.querySelector("[name=pass]").value = "whatever"')

[2013-02-14 15:32:06] jlipps: bern1, she's trying to do something different
[2013-02-14 15:32:19] jlipps: oh sorry i'm out of context
[2013-02-14 15:32:22] jlipps: please continue
[2013-02-14 15:32:49] jlipps: berni's right that execute_script will execute JS in the web frame
[2013-02-14 15:32:55] jlipps: no matter what webdriver language you're usiong
[2013-02-14 15:33:12] mlai_: hmm, so, something like the 'submit' workaround, like self.wd.execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT, { "value":["m","l","a","i","@",...]})
[2013-02-14 15:33:36] berni1: jlipps: does sending keys to an active element work now for web frames?
[2013-02-14 15:33:53] berni1: I was using JS workaround when I wrote mine part using Safari
[2013-02-14 15:34:11] jlipps: berni1: mlai_ actually i don't think we've implemented sendkeys yet in web frame
[2013-02-14 15:34:20] jlipps: so berni1's workaround may be the only way in a webview for now
[2013-02-14 15:34:47] mlai_: hmm, i'll give that a try. I didn't know you could execute js in the python execute. neat
[2013-02-14 15:36:33] jlipps: mlai_: using driver.execute_script(), not driver.execute()
[2013-02-14 15:37:25] jlipps: driver.execute is (i believe) a purely internal thing to python bindings
[2013-02-14 15:37:41] jlipps: driver.execute_script is the implementation of selenium POST /execute method
[2013-02-14 15:39:57] toks: o.o
[2013-02-14 15:40:56] toks: I have to do this to type on the iOS keyboard...  driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement",{'value':list(servername)})
[2013-02-14 15:48:23] mlai_: hm, i'm trying this: self.wd.execute_script('document.querySelector("[name=pass]").value = "blah"') and the server shows: info: Responding to client with error: {"status":7,"value":{"message":"An element could not be located on the page using the given search parameters."},"sessionId":"e4dbc284-a754-4435-be4a-576750d12827"}
[2013-02-14 15:48:40] mlai_: but i've verified the name of those elements are indeed name, pass, login.
[2013-02-14 15:50:07] berni1: that's strange cause you're not even locating an element .. you're just executing some JS
[2013-02-14 15:50:21] berni1: are you sure you've copied the right console output?
[2013-02-14 15:50:34] berni1: maybe this error happens later? or earlier?
[2013-02-14 15:50:46] berni1: (with not being able to find an element)
[2013-02-14 15:53:06] mlai_: I don't see any text getting injected.. and seems like that is aligning with those server responses. hrmm.
[2013-02-14 15:53:55] mlai_: oh wait… i might have just gotten it to work… one sec
[2013-02-14 15:57:46] toks: hey so... ya know what would be swell? :) ...if appium could rest the iOS simulator to be empty; no app installed.. no nothing

[2013-02-14 15:59:34] berni1: agreed - that would be sweet

[2013-02-14 16:00:43] mlai_: errrr, not quite :\ still poking at it
[2013-02-14 16:01:21] berni1: show us what you're sending and some console logs
[2013-02-14 16:05:56] mlai_: hmm, the fb page that loads suddenly has a new "not logged in" page that i need to click "back to home" tried resetting sim and it still goes there
[2013-02-14 16:06:15] toks: ya know what else would be nice? ruby has rspec+parallel_tests ....python has behave+[UNDEFINED] !
[2013-02-14 16:06:36] toks: (off topic)
[2013-02-14 16:06:55] berni1: mlai_:  that's strange I always had the same state after going to iOS Simulator > Reset content ...
[2013-02-14 16:07:52] mlai_: berni1: hm, maybe it's fb's way of thwarting too many login attempts..

[2013-02-14 16:08:37] toks: yup
[2013-02-14 16:08:51] toks: it's actually kinda nice to be honest. I thought it was just going to be a pain
[2013-02-14 16:09:05] jlipps: yeah i'm joking a bit. i like rspec a lot
[2013-02-14 16:09:31] jlipps: and we're using mocha for appium
[2013-02-14 16:09:34] jlipps: sort of bdd-lite
[2013-02-14 16:09:39] toks: one idea I'm toying with though, is to write my own parallels_behave
[2013-02-14 16:09:49] jlipps: that could be really awesome
[2013-02-14 16:09:56] jlipps: parallel support is the hardest thing in any test lib
[2013-02-14 16:09:56] toks: because "behave -d" will give you a list of all the test it _would_ have ran
[2013-02-14 16:10:10] jlipps: yeah you could write a wrapper
[2013-02-14 16:10:15] jlipps: native support would be nice though :-)
[2013-02-14 16:10:19] toks: truth
[2013-02-14 16:10:44] toks: and my solution would create threads/processes that won't share the "context" object between tests
[2013-02-14 16:11:15] mlai_: berni1: what selector would i have to send to click on the hyperlinks "Back to home"?
[2013-02-14 16:12:25] berni1: you should have an URL of the webpage appium/safari is showing in console log
[2013-02-14 16:12:50] berni1: just paste it to the browser and you should be able to get that element using firebug/webkit inspector
[2013-02-14 16:13:41] berni1: best way is to just open the page with a normal browser and check what are name elmenets there
[2013-02-14 16:15:03] mlai_: berni1: clever.. really helps

[2013-02-14 16:19:13] sassda: hum, if I remember correctly, I think safari gives you the ability to display a webkit inspector of safari running in the simulator
[2013-02-14 16:25:16] mlai_: bites.. i keep getting this in the server log: WIRURLKey: 'https://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?type=user_agent&display=touch&redirect_uri=fb423421184384741%3A%2F%2Fauthorize&sdk=ios&scope=email&client_id=423421184384741',

[2013-02-14 16:25:40] mlai_: but going to that page just gives me the normal login
[2013-02-14 16:25:58] mlai_: (in real browser)
[2013-02-14 16:26:09] toks: hmm
[2013-02-14 16:26:34] toks: does your real browser redirect you away from m.facebook?
[2013-02-14 16:26:40] toks: that's what I'd expect to happen

[2013-02-14 16:28:14] berni1: I'm getting mobile page
[2013-02-14 16:28:31] mlai_: 'document.querySelector("button[type=submit]").click();'  would you hazard a guess that the selector for a hyperlink might be "link[name="Back to home"]?
[2013-02-14 16:28:40] berni1: using chrome
[2013-02-14 16:28:56] berni1: http://cl.ly/image/1E1m3V1e2A1t
[2013-02-14 16:28:57] mlai_: yeah, i get the mobile page just fine in chrome
[2013-02-14 16:29:38] berni1: best to check what selector you can use with Tools > Developer Tools
[2013-02-14 16:29:52] mlai_: huh.. that's odd that you get auth'ed
[2013-02-14 16:30:00] berni1: Cmd + Alt + i
[2013-02-14 16:30:46] berni1: cancel button has name=cancel_clicked
[2013-02-14 16:30:57] berni1: and id=cancel_clicked
[2013-02-14 16:31:24] berni1: so you could just do:
[2013-02-14 16:31:25] berni1: document.querySelector("button[id=cancel_clicked]").click();
[2013-02-14 16:31:27] berni1: or
[2013-02-14 16:31:38] mlai_: i can't get to the page that's loading in my sim… http://cl.ly/image/0z3L3J3g0H0H
[2013-02-14 16:31:43] berni1: document.querySelector("#cancel_clicked").click();
[2013-02-14 16:32:06] mlai_: so strange. definitely the first time i've ever seen this page.
[2013-02-14 16:32:13] berni1: I was seeing this only couple days ago when FB OAuth was down
[2013-02-14 16:32:21] mlai_: huh...
[2013-02-14 16:32:22] berni1: maybe some login limits
[2013-02-14 16:32:34] berni1: try to reset the emu
[2013-02-14 16:32:45] mlai_: yeah did that several times
[2013-02-14 16:32:46] berni1: and login to the FB with safaru
[2013-02-14 16:32:48] berni1: safari
[2013-02-14 16:32:52] mlai_: okay, i'll try
[2013-02-14 16:32:52] berni1: without running appiu,
[2013-02-14 16:33:17] berni1: if won't work I guess that's sth about auth limits / FB in general
[2013-02-14 16:35:47] berni1: need to get some sleep, ping me if there are some other problems and I'll re when I'm back
[2013-02-14 16:36:04] mlai_: thanks for all the help today berni1. really appreciate it
