[2013-02-12 10:31:07] toks: so, last episode
[2013-02-12 10:32:37] toks: The app I'm trying to automate thinks a textfield is still empty
[2013-02-12 10:32:50] toks: even though I've filled the name using UIATextField.send_keys()
[2013-02-12 10:33:02] rodericj, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:33:18] toks: in the webbrowser world, this kind of issue tends to be fixed by focus() and blur()
[2013-02-12 10:33:39] toks: to tell the UI that a human did click on it, then blur() to say "ok, now re-evaluate the contents"
[2013-02-12 10:33:57] toks: ....I guess I could try clicking somewhere else after typing
[2013-02-12 10:48:34] nags, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:50:28] nags: jlipps, one more question, is UIAutomation restricted with the test app we are planing to test and beyond that we can't do testing ? its similar to my yesterday's question
[2013-02-12 10:51:12] jlipps: toks, try making the keyboard go away?
[2013-02-12 10:51:32] jlipps: nags, you can also automate e.g. mobile safari
[2013-02-12 10:52:03] jlipps: but you have to have the simulator version of the .app you want to run
[2013-02-12 10:52:16] jlipps: so not just any other app
[2013-02-12 10:52:45] nags: jlipps, ok, as long as we have the other app, we can automate ?
[2013-02-12 10:52:52] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 10:53:08] nags: jlipps, if I launch second app with Instruments, it just hang the complete test
[2013-02-12 10:53:18] jlipps: nags, you can't automate them both in the same run
[2013-02-12 10:53:24] *toks goes to try stuff...'
[2013-02-12 10:53:30] jlipps: each run shuts down instruments
[2013-02-12 10:53:37] nags: jlipps, that's the issue
[2013-02-12 10:53:49] jlipps: yeah, since we use instruments under the hood, we can't get around that
[2013-02-12 10:54:15] nags: jlipps, got you, thanks for the info :-)
[2013-02-12 10:54:19] jlipps: for most people this shouldn't be a problem even if they are testing app interaction
[2013-02-12 10:54:25] jlipps: since the simulator remembers app preferences
[2013-02-12 10:54:34] nags: jlipps, ok
[2013-02-12 10:54:38] jlipps: (i believe)
[2013-02-12 10:54:39] admc, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:54:57] jlipps: but maybe it just won't work for your use case, not sure
[2013-02-12 10:55:07] jlipps: good luck!
[2013-02-12 10:55:09] nags: jlipps, ok, let me explore more
[2013-02-12 10:55:12] nags: jlipps, sure, thanks

[2013-02-12 11:17:33] toks: hmm...
[2013-02-12 11:17:37] toks: very strange
[2013-02-12 11:19:52] toks: I really can't get appium to make the app believe there's text in that field
[2013-02-12 11:20:06] toks: it's definitely the right textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:14] toks: cuz it's the only textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:28] toks: driver.find_elements('type','UIATextField') returns an array of 1
[2013-02-12 11:24:55] jlipps, quitting. (*.net *.split)
[2013-02-12 11:25:53] toks: netslpit?
[2013-02-12 11:25:57] toks: those still happen?
[2013-02-12 11:25:58] toks: :p
[2013-02-12 11:30:54] sassda: toks: what do you mean making the app believe there is text in that field? do you mean its a case where the app should react to text input?
[2013-02-12 11:33:08] toks: when I click "save"
[2013-02-12 11:33:17] toks: I get an error that there's no text in the field
[2013-02-12 11:33:32] toks: when I do this manually on the iOS sim, it works fine
[2013-02-12 11:33:41] toks: so some kind of event isn't firing when appium does it
[2013-02-12 11:34:56] toks: typically in the webbrowser automation world, this issue would be resolved by using focus() and blur() on said element
[2013-02-12 11:43:19] toks: also... does appium allow me to touch the iOS-virtual-keyboard?

[2013-02-12 12:16:24] sp0cksbeard: the text returns the title
[2013-02-12 12:16:40] sp0cksbeard: i mean the "text" attribute on an alert currently returns the title

[2013-02-12 12:18:35] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 12:18:58] toks: for me, an iOS native app... driver.switch_to_alert().text gives me the text in the box
[2013-02-12 12:19:25] toks: or maybe I'm just lucky that the alert title and contents are the same or something
[2013-02-12 12:20:08] sp0cksbeard: i see. here the message is different from the title, and it's only returning the title
