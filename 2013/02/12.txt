[2013-02-12 10:31:07] toks: so, last episode
[2013-02-12 10:32:37] toks: The app I'm trying to automate thinks a textfield is still empty
[2013-02-12 10:32:50] toks: even though I've filled the name using UIATextField.send_keys()
[2013-02-12 10:33:02] rodericj, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:33:18] toks: in the webbrowser world, this kind of issue tends to be fixed by focus() and blur()
[2013-02-12 10:33:39] toks: to tell the UI that a human did click on it, then blur() to say "ok, now re-evaluate the contents"
[2013-02-12 10:33:57] toks: ....I guess I could try clicking somewhere else after typing
[2013-02-12 10:48:34] nags, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:50:28] nags: jlipps, one more question, is UIAutomation restricted with the test app we are planing to test and beyond that we can't do testing ? its similar to my yesterday's question
[2013-02-12 10:51:12] jlipps: toks, try making the keyboard go away?
[2013-02-12 10:51:32] jlipps: nags, you can also automate e.g. mobile safari
[2013-02-12 10:52:03] jlipps: but you have to have the simulator version of the .app you want to run
[2013-02-12 10:52:16] jlipps: so not just any other app
[2013-02-12 10:52:45] nags: jlipps, ok, as long as we have the other app, we can automate ?
[2013-02-12 10:52:52] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 10:53:08] nags: jlipps, if I launch second app with Instruments, it just hang the complete test
[2013-02-12 10:53:18] jlipps: nags, you can't automate them both in the same run
[2013-02-12 10:53:24] *toks goes to try stuff...'
[2013-02-12 10:53:30] jlipps: each run shuts down instruments
[2013-02-12 10:53:37] nags: jlipps, that's the issue
[2013-02-12 10:53:49] jlipps: yeah, since we use instruments under the hood, we can't get around that
[2013-02-12 10:54:15] nags: jlipps, got you, thanks for the info :-)
[2013-02-12 10:54:19] jlipps: for most people this shouldn't be a problem even if they are testing app interaction
[2013-02-12 10:54:25] jlipps: since the simulator remembers app preferences
[2013-02-12 10:54:34] nags: jlipps, ok
[2013-02-12 10:54:38] jlipps: (i believe)

[2013-02-12 10:55:09] nags: jlipps, ok, let me explore more

[2013-02-12 11:17:37] toks: very strange
[2013-02-12 11:19:52] toks: I really can't get appium to make the app believe there's text in that field
[2013-02-12 11:20:06] toks: it's definitely the right textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:14] toks: cuz it's the only textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:28] toks: driver.find_elements('type','UIATextField') returns an array of 1

[2013-02-12 11:25:53] toks: netslpit?
[2013-02-12 11:25:57] toks: those still happen?
[2013-02-12 11:25:58] toks: :p
[2013-02-12 11:30:54] sassda: toks: what do you mean making the app believe there is text in that field? do you mean its a case where the app should react to text input?
[2013-02-12 11:33:08] toks: when I click "save"
[2013-02-12 11:33:17] toks: I get an error that there's no text in the field
[2013-02-12 11:33:32] toks: when I do this manually on the iOS sim, it works fine
[2013-02-12 11:33:41] toks: so some kind of event isn't firing when appium does it
[2013-02-12 11:34:56] toks: typically in the webbrowser automation world, this issue would be resolved by using focus() and blur() on said element
[2013-02-12 11:43:19] toks: also... does appium allow me to touch the iOS-virtual-keyboard?

[2013-02-12 12:16:24] sp0cksbeard: the text returns the title
[2013-02-12 12:16:40] sp0cksbeard: i mean the "text" attribute on an alert currently returns the title
[2013-02-12 12:16:53] toks: yes

[2013-02-12 12:17:33] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 12:18:18] sp0cksbeard: this is a native app

[2013-02-12 12:18:35] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 12:18:58] toks: for me, an iOS native app... driver.switch_to_alert().text gives me the text in the box
[2013-02-12 12:19:25] toks: or maybe I'm just lucky that the alert title and contents are the same or something
[2013-02-12 12:20:08] sp0cksbeard: i see. here the message is different from the title, and it's only returning the title
[2013-02-12 12:20:39] sp0cksbeard: i'm trying this on an appium checkout from github, updated this afternoon

[2013-02-12 12:45:48] toks: heh
[2013-02-12 12:46:00] toks: well... I wanted to automate some iOS testing here.... but...
[2013-02-12 12:46:14] toks: there is something happening with a required textfield in our app
[2013-02-12 12:46:18] toks: (native app)
[2013-02-12 12:46:32] toks: in that, in the simulator, when I enter the text manually... it works
[2013-02-12 12:46:49] toks: when appium does it, the app still thinks the field is empty and won't move forward
[2013-02-12 12:47:07] toks: I see no other appium api to get around this
[2013-02-12 12:47:23] sp0cksbeard: do you know if they textfield is the default text field or a custom widget?
[2013-02-12 12:47:41] toks: I find it by doing find_elements('type','UIATextField')
[2013-02-12 12:47:45] toks: returns an array of
[2013-02-12 12:47:47] toks: 1
[2013-02-12 12:48:12] sp0cksbeard: and the name/label of that field is the one you think it is?
[2013-02-12 12:48:26] sp0cksbeard: i suppose it will be, but just want to be sure
[2013-02-12 12:48:26] toks: yeah, there's only one textfield on the screen
[2013-02-12 12:48:55] toks: it's in a tablecell
[2013-02-12 12:49:11] toks: so I've tried clicking on the UIATableCell it's in
[2013-02-12 12:49:23] sp0cksbeard: what driver are you using?
[2013-02-12 12:49:29] toks: python's
[2013-02-12 12:49:58] sp0cksbeard: have you tried the "driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement", {'value': ['a', 'b',…]})?
[2013-02-12 12:50:13] sp0cksbeard: assuming the textfield is selected
[2013-02-12 12:50:14] toks: execute works in appium now?
[2013-02-12 12:50:27] sp0cksbeard: i know it works on the build i'm using

[2013-02-12 12:52:32] toks: where is that documented?
[2013-02-12 12:52:46] sp0cksbeard: i'd to look at the command.py file inside selenium package
[2013-02-12 12:53:02] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 12:53:07] sp0cksbeard: it has a list of supported commands. of course, I'd to figure out the parameter signature myself
[2013-02-12 12:53:26] sp0cksbeard: look in "selenium-2.29.0-py2.7.egg/selenium/webdriver/remote/command.py"
[2013-02-12 12:53:44] sp0cksbeard: it has a list of constants that are the various commands that "execute" will support
[2013-02-12 12:54:21] sp0cksbeard: or the version of selenium you're using, which should be the most recent hopefully
[2013-02-12 12:54:32] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 12:56:00] toks: this is epic
[2013-02-12 12:56:15] toks: thanks, there's a bunch more commands in there I didn't know about
[2013-02-12 12:56:48] toks: hey, I see getAlertText in there

[2013-02-12 13:01:08] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 13:01:16] toks: sounds like an issue to me
[2013-02-12 13:02:08] toks: man, even dragElement is here
[2013-02-12 13:05:11] sp0cksbeard: one thing though, appium doesn't support every command from what I understand - they're working on implementing it all, but not yet there yet
[2013-02-12 13:06:11] toks: ah, yeah... I see that in the server.js logs... everytime I see 501, then I know "okay, they haven't done this yet"
[2013-02-12 13:06:50] sp0cksbeard: is any core-committer for appium here right now?
[2013-02-12 13:07:04] toks: they're not talking

[2013-02-12 13:10:17] sp0cksbeard: will wait till they're here to see if the current behavior of the alert is expected. unfortunately, the webdriver wire protocol only supports "alert_text", and not "alert_title". that would have made the semantics a bit clear

[2013-02-12 13:18:43] toks: yeah
[2013-02-12 13:19:00] toks: or maybe just return both and split it with nulls or something :p

[2013-02-12 13:22:18] jcarr: I think a github issue is a good place to raise that
[2013-02-12 13:22:21] sp0cksbeard: i was looking the UIAutomation javascript framework, and the "name" just says "name attribute of the elemtn"
[2013-02-12 13:24:04] sp0cksbeard: jcarr: i suspect the issue is while in the UIAutomation, the alert supports APIs for a regular element, in webdriver there are only 4 apis for that
[2013-02-12 13:24:13] sp0cksbeard: so it becomes a mapping issue
[2013-02-12 13:24:49] jcarr: then yeah github is the right place
[2013-02-12 13:24:59] jcarr: agree, by the way, with your analysis
[2013-02-12 13:25:14] sp0cksbeard: will add an issue. thanks

[2013-02-12 13:58:09] toks: so, looking at how sendKeysToActiveElement works
[2013-02-12 13:58:24] toks: it grabs the iOS keyboard, and makes it type the text
[2013-02-12 13:58:32] toks: (according to the log of server.js)
[2013-02-12 13:59:00] toks: rather that whatever magicsmoke makes UIATextField.send_keys() works

[2013-02-12 14:29:39] sp0cksbeard: i see. i wonder if you could deploy the one with the alert fixes (thanks for that, btw!) so I can set up our CI infrastructure
[2013-02-12 14:30:00] jlipps: happy to. working on another change atm and will publish as soon as i get that in
[2013-02-12 14:30:07] jlipps: (~10/15 min)

[2013-02-12 15:00:13] sfbrian: jlipps: does 0.0.12 have your commit in it from this pull request? https://github.com/appium/appium/pull/155
[2013-02-12 15:00:35] jlipps: sfbrian: yes

[2013-02-12 15:04:25] sfbrian: nice
[2013-02-12 15:04:57] sfbrian: looking forward to that as I'm struggling trying to deal with the keyboard element in my app
[2013-02-12 15:05:13] sfbrian: just starting looking at appium so not sure if I'm doing something wrong

[2013-02-12 15:23:45] sfbrian: jlipps: this might sound like a noob question but how do you update appium? I'm trying npm install appium and npm update appium and it's still at 0.0.10 for me
[2013-02-12 15:24:40] stackedsax, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 15:26:07] jlipps: sfbrian: did you install appium globally?
[2013-02-12 15:26:21] nags: jlipps, this is what I got as response http://pastebin.com/TSutXQU3
[2013-02-12 15:26:35] sfbrian: jlipps: I think so
[2013-02-12 15:27:04] nags: jlipps, I'm new to Objective-C / iOS, can you guide me ? how this can go with appium ?
[2013-02-12 15:27:20] jlipps: sfbrian: or did you install it locally (i.e. do you have a node_modules/ directory)
[2013-02-12 15:28:12] jlipps: if you installed it locally
[2013-02-12 15:28:14] sfbrian: jlipps: actually, you're right, it's local.
[2013-02-12 15:28:16] jlipps: you can just type "npm update"
[2013-02-12 15:28:25] sfbrian: appium is in /usr/local/bin which appium -> ../lib/node_modules/appium/app/bin.js
[2013-02-12 15:29:18] jlipps: oh i see
[2013-02-12 15:29:25] jlipps: then try this: "npm update appium -g"
[2013-02-12 15:30:01] sfbrian: nice, that did it
[2013-02-12 15:30:39] sfbrian: yeah, npm is a bit confusing… i'm used to pip :)
[2013-02-12 15:30:40] santiycr1, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 15:30:46] jlipps: yeah :-)
[2013-02-12 15:30:55] sfbrian: thanks dude
[2013-02-12 15:31:01] jlipps: np
[2013-02-12 15:31:55] jlipps: nags, i don't think that approach will work with appium
[2013-02-12 15:32:23] jlipps: since we use instruments and not a 3rd-party internal server like frank, we are limited by only having one instruments process going at a time
[2013-02-12 15:33:44] santiycr, quitting. (Read error: Operation timed out)
[2013-02-12 15:34:08] nags: jlipps, ok
[2013-02-12 15:39:42] sfbrian: jlipps: unfortunately your update to driver.execute didn't work for me
[2013-02-12 15:39:52] jlipps: sfbrian: what are you trying to do
[2013-02-12 15:40:12] sfbrian: maybe my syntax is wrong but here's an example:
[2013-02-12 15:40:13] sfbrian: self.driver.execute("target.frontMostApp().tabBar().buttons()['MY TICKETS'].tap();")
[2013-02-12 15:41:16] sfbrian: the error is: KeyError: "target.frontMostApp().tabBar().buttons()['MY TICKETS'].tap();"
[2013-02-12 15:43:00] jlipps: hmm
[2013-02-12 15:43:45] sfbrian: using python
[2013-02-12 15:44:38] jlipps: sfbrian: you want driver.execute_script
[2013-02-12 15:44:41] jlipps: driver.execute is an internal thing
[2013-02-12 15:45:10] jlipps: also, i feel there should be a better non-UIAuto way to get that button
[2013-02-12 15:45:23] sfbrian: wow, I feel dumb today
[2013-02-12 15:45:27] sfbrian: yeah, that was it
[2013-02-12 15:45:29] jlipps: maybe we need to create a way to select the "tabbar" element first or something
[2013-02-12 15:46:11] sfbrian: jlipps: there is a non UIAuto way to do it. I was just testing with that button
[2013-02-12 15:46:23] jlipps: oh ok cool
[2013-02-12 15:46:47] sfbrian: jlipps: the real one I really wanted to do was this:
[2013-02-12 15:46:49] sfbrian: target.frontMostApp().keyboard().typeString("\n");
[2013-02-12 15:46:54] jlipps: ah
[2013-02-12 15:47:04] sfbrian: appium doesn't like send_keys("\n")
[2013-02-12 15:47:08] jlipps: by "\n" do you mean hit the go button
[2013-02-12 15:47:18] jlipps: or enter a newline
[2013-02-12 15:47:30] sfbrian: go button
[2013-02-12 15:47:56] sfbrian: that's what instruments gives me when recording
[2013-02-12 15:48:09] jlipps: sfbrian: 2 things:
[2013-02-12 15:48:57] jlipps: 1) python bindings don't have a way to call POST /keys, but gaige and i have a discussion about getting around that here: https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/152
[2013-02-12 15:49:09] jlipps: (basically something like this: self.driver.execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT, { "value":["TopLayer"]}))
[2013-02-12 15:49:26] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 15:49:35] jlipps: 2) to hit the go button send "\\uE007"
[2013-02-12 15:49:42] sfbrian: ah
[2013-02-12 15:50:05] jlipps: inspired by this: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element/:id/value
[2013-02-12 15:50:19] jlipps: (the "Enter" key)
[2013-02-12 15:50:49] toks: what?! I can get to tap() from driver.execute?
[2013-02-12 15:50:52] sfbrian: yeah, Enter key gives me an icon of a sneaker. LOL
[2013-02-12 15:51:16] jlipps: sfbrian, that's because python is using the wrong selenium endpoint
[2013-02-12 15:51:19] jlipps: it's using /value
[2013-02-12 15:51:23] jlipps: we want /keys
[2013-02-12 15:51:26] nags: jlipps, do appium support running tests in device as well ? since it uses instruments internally I feel it will support device, just asking
[2013-02-12 15:51:35] jlipps: nags, yes
[2013-02-12 15:51:37] sfbrian: ah
[2013-02-12 15:52:11] nags: jlipps, awesome, thanks, let me try automating things with appium and see how that goes
[2013-02-12 15:52:27] *toks would love to know where that javscript looking syntax is coming from in that driver.execute()'
[2013-02-12 15:52:32] jlipps: sfbrian: this is why you need to do self.driver.execute(Command…. blah blah blah);
[2013-02-12 15:52:36] jlipps: toks
[2013-02-12 15:52:38] nags: jlipps, one last question for now, does appium take screenshots as well ?
[2013-02-12 15:52:50] sfbrian: ok, i'll give that a shot
[2013-02-12 15:52:52] jlipps: toks you can run arbitrary UIAutomation JS
[2013-02-12 15:52:54] jlipps: nags, yes
[2013-02-12 15:53:01] toks: jlipps: that is epic
[2013-02-12 15:53:04] jlipps: check the appium test code, there's examples of it
[2013-02-12 15:53:13] *toks can confirm screenshot works '
[2013-02-12 15:53:16] toks: :)
[2013-02-12 15:53:18] *jlipps warns toks that with great power comes great responsibility'
[2013-02-12 15:53:24] nags: jlipps, I think, I should start automation VMware Horizon now using appium
[2013-02-12 15:53:27] toks: ha
[2013-02-12 15:53:50] jlipps: nags, not sure what that means!
[2013-02-12 15:53:54] toks: VMware has an iOS app?
[2013-02-12 15:54:09] nags: jlipps, its a product from VMware
[2013-02-12 15:54:19] toks: oh... https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vmware-view-client/id417993697?mt=8
[2013-02-12 15:54:21] toks: I guess so
[2013-02-12 15:54:24] nags: toks, ya, coming up with mobile virtualization app ;-)
[2013-02-12 15:54:35] nags: toks, for enterprise
[2013-02-12 15:54:37] toks: O_o;
[2013-02-12 15:54:41] toks: whoa, really?
[2013-02-12 15:54:43] jlipps: oh i see nags
[2013-02-12 15:55:01] toks: I hear there are licensing issues with running multiple iOS simulators
[2013-02-12 15:55:31] sourishkrout, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 15:55:40] toks: been thinking how to fool OSX into running more than one iOS-sim at one time
[2013-02-12 15:55:47] nags: https://twitter.com/VMwareHorizon
[2013-02-12 15:55:50] toks: and how to patch appium to handle it
[2013-02-12 15:56:10] toks: nags: good times
[2013-02-12 15:56:17] nags: toks, thanks :-)
[2013-02-12 15:56:35] jlipps: nags we'd love to figure that out
[2013-02-12 15:56:39] jlipps: let us know what you come up with
[2013-02-12 15:56:45] nags: jlipps, sure :-)
[2013-02-12 15:57:26] jlipps: nags with multiple vms would this be a problem?
[2013-02-12 15:57:52] nags: jlipps, which one ?
[2013-02-12 15:58:18] jlipps: could you do what you need by running different instances of appium on different VMs?
[2013-02-12 15:58:34] nags: jlipps, nope
[2013-02-12 15:59:08] nags: jlipps, our current product have a single sign on feature (not yet released to the market) - Confidential :-D
[2013-02-12 15:59:26] nags: jlipps, which will connect to the server for auth
[2013-02-12 15:59:36] nags: jlipps, then launches respective app for the required task
[2013-02-12 16:00:06] nags: jlipps, like Horizon Data (equivalent to Google Drive), VMware View etc
[2013-02-12 16:00:36] jlipps: i see what you're saying
[2013-02-12 16:00:42] nags: jlipps, based on the customer license, they can get respective app and associate in to their catalog
[2013-02-12 16:00:43] jlipps: well as long as you don't have to get back to the original app
[2013-02-12 16:00:45] jlipps: i think appium will work
[2013-02-12 16:01:00] nags: jlipps, for now, no need to come back to original app
[2013-02-12 16:01:01] jlipps: i believe links to launch other apps will work automatically
[2013-02-12 16:01:08] jlipps: as long as that app already exists on the sim
[2013-02-12 16:01:17] jlipps: which you can guarantee by running an empty test with that app first
[2013-02-12 16:01:17] nags: jlipps, but yes both the app will exist
[2013-02-12 16:01:57] nags: jlipps, after auth, first app will show list of supported app for current user and on clicking the respective icon, second / third app launches and the session continues
[2013-02-12 16:02:10] nags: *continue from second / third app
[2013-02-12 16:03:01] jlipps: gotcha
[2013-02-12 16:03:29] nags: jlipps, I know :-)
[2013-02-12 16:03:48] nags: jlipps, thats what enterprise need ;-)
[2013-02-12 16:03:52] jlipps: ok, well excited to see whether this will work for you
[2013-02-12 16:04:33] nags: jlipps, sure, thanks, guess I'm going to bug you with too many questions
[2013-02-12 16:04:50] nags: once I start automating
[2013-02-12 16:04:54] jlipps: i'll do what i can when i can
[2013-02-12 16:05:06] jlipps: my secret plan is to tell you just enough so you can contribute stuff yourself :-)
[2013-02-12 16:05:27] toks: heh
[2013-02-12 16:06:25] sfbrian: jlipps: That didn't work quite right. I was able to get the SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT to work correctly and it types in what I want. But when I get to sending the enter key things blow up
[2013-02-12 16:06:34] jlipps: sfbrian: sweet
[2013-02-12 16:06:45] nags: jlipps, I agree with you
[2013-02-12 16:08:15] jlipps: sfbrian: how do they blow up exactly?
[2013-02-12 16:08:43] sfbrian: I have something like this
[2013-02-12 16:08:46] sfbrian: self.driver.execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT, { "value":["Test"]})
[2013-02-12 16:08:47] sfbrian:         self.driver.execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT, { "value":["\\uE007"]})
[2013-02-12 16:08:57] sfbrian: I get the always useful: WebDriverException: Message: ''
[2013-02-12 16:10:19] nags: jlipps, maybe another instance is already running, that's the reason user gets exception ? stack=[Error: listen EADDRINUSE, at errnoException (net.js:770:11) https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/172
[2013-02-12 16:11:21] jlipps: nags, that could be too--i just replied with my personal guess that it's a socket hanging around due to running with sudo previously
[2013-02-12 16:11:31] toks: oh
[2013-02-12 16:11:37] toks: that's what happens to me
[2013-02-12 16:11:38] nags: jlipps, ok
[2013-02-12 16:11:38] jlipps: sfbrian: what does appium server log say?
[2013-02-12 16:11:53] toks: that usually means server.js is running somewhere
[2013-02-12 16:11:54] toks: or instruments
[2013-02-12 16:12:01] toks: type "lsof -i"
[2013-02-12 16:12:13] toks: I bet you'll see the process holding port 4723 or whatever
[2013-02-12 16:12:36] jlipps: yep. the socket one is harder to diagnose though
[2013-02-12 16:12:42] jlipps: and it also generates the EADDRINUSE error
[2013-02-12 16:12:47] admc: maybe we should make it so that if 4723 isn't available we just increment the port until we get one thats available
[2013-02-12 16:12:53] jlipps: and in this case the error is in instruments.js
[2013-02-12 16:12:57] jlipps: which doesn't know about 4723
[2013-02-12 16:13:01] jlipps: but does know about the socket
[2013-02-12 16:13:20] jlipps: admc, client tests need to know the port though
[2013-02-12 16:13:26] jlipps: and you can set it when you start appium
[2013-02-12 16:13:30] admc: what if appium set an env variable

[2013-02-12 16:14:28] sfbrian: does the button literally have to be called "Go"?
[2013-02-12 16:14:30] jlipps: admc, clients can be on different machines
[2013-02-12 16:15:18] admc: maybe we should write a service designed to launch appium on a non locked up port, called appium-appium ;)
[2013-02-12 16:15:18] jlipps: sfbrian: just checked and indeed that's hardcoded
[2013-02-12 16:15:18] admc: lolz

[2013-02-12 16:15:44] jlipps: :-)
[2013-02-12 16:15:45] sfbrian: jlipps: ah. My button is called "Search"
[2013-02-12 16:15:50] sfbrian: d'oh
[2013-02-12 16:15:57] jlipps: sfbrian: yes, good point. this needs to be more general.
[2013-02-12 16:16:50] jlipps: sfbrian: i'll add a method for hitting named keyboard buttons
[2013-02-12 16:16:58] sfbrian: nice!
[2013-02-12 16:17:29] nags: jlipps, I guess you mentioned appium supports Safari as well, if so, is there an example available in git repo ?
[2013-02-12 16:17:48] nags: I'm looking at this now https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/sample-code/examples/python/uicatalog.py
[2013-02-12 16:18:00] sassda: in UIA, if you just do something like target.frontMostApp().keyboard().typeString("\n"); this will make the effect of pressing the action button, whatever the label, wouldn't that be a safest generic approach?
[2013-02-12 16:18:07] jlipps: nags, not yet
[2013-02-12 16:18:24] jlipps: sassda, trouble is we don't know what the action button is?
[2013-02-12 16:18:25] jlipps: or do we?
[2013-02-12 16:18:31] jlipps: i thought we had to access it by name, which can change
[2013-02-12 16:18:55] sassda: thats my point, by just submiting the "\n" string, the button name doesn't matter anymore
[2013-02-12 16:19:04] sassda: in my app, its called search also
[2013-02-12 16:19:15] jlipps: sassda: but my point is that on the UIAutomation side, we need to know what it's called
[2013-02-12 16:19:32] nags: jlipps, I should not have asked 2 questions ;-) not yet for "Safari not supported yet" or "no examples for web automation" ?
[2013-02-12 16:20:03] jlipps: nags, examples for web automation are in webview.js
[2013-02-12 16:20:09] jlipps: those could apply to safari but no examples for that yet
[2013-02-12 16:20:12] nags: jlipps, let me check
[2013-02-12 16:20:27] sassda: why do you need to know how its called, you are just submitting a string through the keyboard, the string will get send to the active element
[2013-02-12 16:21:40] sfbrian: jlipps: Let me know when there is a ticket to follow for that change. I'll be looking forward to it.
[2013-02-12 16:24:06] jlipps: sassda, the special buttons like "Go" and "Search" aren't submitted that way
[2013-02-12 16:24:11] jlipps: you actually have to tap buttons on the keyboard element
[2013-02-12 16:24:48] sassda: lemme double check on my side, this is how we have it in our current automation using UIA
[2013-02-12 16:25:01] sfbrian: jlipps: Thanks for all the help. I'll have to buy you a beer sometime. You work at Sauce right?
[2013-02-12 16:25:27] jlipps: sfbrian: yep! be happy to have one with you sometime
[2013-02-12 16:25:38] jlipps: sassda: that would be interesting, let me know
[2013-02-12 16:26:27] sfbrian: jlipps: city beer has Alpine day today. I love beer week
[2013-02-12 16:27:22] sassda: ok, just tried, and it works for my app, and I assure you, there is nothing fancy about it :D
[2013-02-12 16:27:35] sassda: I got this by actually using the record function in instruments
[2013-02-12 16:28:23] sassda: copy paste from my test http://pastebin.com/LCgHqexe
[2013-02-12 16:29:59] jlipps: sfbrian: i love city beer! live right by there
[2013-02-12 16:30:26] jlipps: sassda, then the issue may be in the selenium proxy part of things
[2013-02-12 16:30:32] jlipps: that is an additional layer of complication
[2013-02-12 16:31:47] sfbrian: jlipps: me too. I practically live there. If you haven't had Alpine, it's a great brewery from San Diego that makes awesome IPAs

[2013-02-12 17:03:07] sfbrian: sassda: that doesn't work for me
[2013-02-12 17:05:47] sassda: one question, when text is being typed in your app, do you see the keyboard appearing?
[2013-02-12 17:12:17] toks: oh... you have that keyboard issue too?
[2013-02-12 17:12:30] toks: I was just told the solution for that
[2013-02-12 17:12:45] sassda: oh?
[2013-02-12 17:12:54] sassda: yes, interested :D
[2013-02-12 17:13:00] toks: you have a thing where you type text in with send_keys(), but your app still thinks the field is empty?
[2013-02-12 17:13:18] jcarr, leaving. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 17:13:22] toks: that's what happened to me
[2013-02-12 17:13:40] toks: I'm in python
[2013-02-12 17:13:59] sfbrian: sassda: yeah, the keyboard appears when it types
[2013-02-12 17:14:10] toks: instead of doing driver.find_element('UIATextField').send_keys("Mycoolname")
[2013-02-12 17:14:20] toks: do driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement",{'value':list("Mycoolname")})
[2013-02-12 17:14:49] toks: but make sure to  UIATextField.click() first
[2013-02-12 17:15:01] toks: it'll send the keys to the keyboard
[2013-02-12 17:15:06] toks: you'll see the keys animate
[2013-02-12 17:15:27] sfbrian: that only works if the keyboard is visible
[2013-02-12 17:15:37] toks: that'll make it visible
[2013-02-12 17:15:41] toks: at least it does for me
[2013-02-12 17:15:47] toks: oh wait...
[2013-02-12 17:15:48] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 17:15:56] toks: maybe the click makes it visible
[2013-02-12 17:16:09] sfbrian: yeah, i have to click on it first
[2013-02-12 17:16:19] sassda: yeah, the fact of tapping on a textfield, brings up the keyboard for sure
[2013-02-12 17:16:38] toks: cool
[2013-02-12 17:16:46] sfbrian: but doing something like this still doesn't press the "Search" button because it's expecting the button to say "Go"
[2013-02-12 17:16:47] sfbrian: self.driver.execute(Command.SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT, { "value":["\\uE007"]})
[2013-02-12 17:17:48] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 17:17:53] toks: double \\ ?
[2013-02-12 17:17:55] sassda: actually, sfbrian, are you familiar with instruments and UIA? could you use the record function and click on the button, see what apple has to say about this ;)
[2013-02-12 17:18:10] sfbrian: yeah, instruments says \n
[2013-02-12 17:18:12] sfbrian: but that doesn't work
[2013-02-12 17:18:18] sassda: oh ok :(
[2013-02-12 17:18:42] toks: is this an alert window?
[2013-02-12 17:18:53] toks: driver.switch_to_alert().dismiss() maybe?
[2013-02-12 17:19:04] sfbrian: jlipps said he is going to work on it to make it work with any button name instead of just Go
[2013-02-12 17:19:44] toks: driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement",{'value':list("\n")})  maybe?
[2013-02-12 17:19:59] toks: er
[2013-02-12 17:20:03] toks: but without the list()
[2013-02-12 17:20:09] sfbrian: tried it, no go
[2013-02-12 17:20:15] toks: argh
[2013-02-12 17:20:17] sassda: yep, I hoped maybe it wouldn't need to go this far, but it seems thats what will be needed
