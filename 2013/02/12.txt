[2013-02-12 10:31:07] toks: so, last episode
[2013-02-12 10:32:37] toks: The app I'm trying to automate thinks a textfield is still empty
[2013-02-12 10:32:50] toks: even though I've filled the name using UIATextField.send_keys()
[2013-02-12 10:33:02] rodericj, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:33:18] toks: in the webbrowser world, this kind of issue tends to be fixed by focus() and blur()
[2013-02-12 10:33:39] toks: to tell the UI that a human did click on it, then blur() to say "ok, now re-evaluate the contents"
[2013-02-12 10:33:57] toks: ....I guess I could try clicking somewhere else after typing
[2013-02-12 10:48:34] nags, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-12 10:50:28] nags: jlipps, one more question, is UIAutomation restricted with the test app we are planing to test and beyond that we can't do testing ? its similar to my yesterday's question
[2013-02-12 10:51:12] jlipps: toks, try making the keyboard go away?
[2013-02-12 10:51:32] jlipps: nags, you can also automate e.g. mobile safari
[2013-02-12 10:52:03] jlipps: but you have to have the simulator version of the .app you want to run
[2013-02-12 10:52:16] jlipps: so not just any other app
[2013-02-12 10:52:45] nags: jlipps, ok, as long as we have the other app, we can automate ?
[2013-02-12 10:52:52] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 10:53:08] nags: jlipps, if I launch second app with Instruments, it just hang the complete test
[2013-02-12 10:53:18] jlipps: nags, you can't automate them both in the same run
[2013-02-12 10:53:24] *toks goes to try stuff...'
[2013-02-12 10:53:30] jlipps: each run shuts down instruments
[2013-02-12 10:53:37] nags: jlipps, that's the issue
[2013-02-12 10:53:49] jlipps: yeah, since we use instruments under the hood, we can't get around that
[2013-02-12 10:54:15] nags: jlipps, got you, thanks for the info :-)
[2013-02-12 10:54:19] jlipps: for most people this shouldn't be a problem even if they are testing app interaction
[2013-02-12 10:54:25] jlipps: since the simulator remembers app preferences
[2013-02-12 10:54:34] nags: jlipps, ok
[2013-02-12 10:54:38] jlipps: (i believe)

[2013-02-12 10:55:09] nags: jlipps, ok, let me explore more

[2013-02-12 11:17:33] toks: hmm...
[2013-02-12 11:17:37] toks: very strange
[2013-02-12 11:19:52] toks: I really can't get appium to make the app believe there's text in that field
[2013-02-12 11:20:06] toks: it's definitely the right textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:14] toks: cuz it's the only textfield
[2013-02-12 11:20:28] toks: driver.find_elements('type','UIATextField') returns an array of 1

[2013-02-12 11:25:53] toks: netslpit?
[2013-02-12 11:25:57] toks: those still happen?
[2013-02-12 11:25:58] toks: :p
[2013-02-12 11:30:54] sassda: toks: what do you mean making the app believe there is text in that field? do you mean its a case where the app should react to text input?
[2013-02-12 11:33:08] toks: when I click "save"
[2013-02-12 11:33:17] toks: I get an error that there's no text in the field
[2013-02-12 11:33:32] toks: when I do this manually on the iOS sim, it works fine
[2013-02-12 11:33:41] toks: so some kind of event isn't firing when appium does it
[2013-02-12 11:34:56] toks: typically in the webbrowser automation world, this issue would be resolved by using focus() and blur() on said element
[2013-02-12 11:43:19] toks: also... does appium allow me to touch the iOS-virtual-keyboard?

[2013-02-12 12:16:24] sp0cksbeard: the text returns the title
[2013-02-12 12:16:40] sp0cksbeard: i mean the "text" attribute on an alert currently returns the title
[2013-02-12 12:16:53] toks: yes

[2013-02-12 12:17:33] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 12:18:18] sp0cksbeard: this is a native app

[2013-02-12 12:18:35] toks: hmm
[2013-02-12 12:18:58] toks: for me, an iOS native app... driver.switch_to_alert().text gives me the text in the box
[2013-02-12 12:19:25] toks: or maybe I'm just lucky that the alert title and contents are the same or something
[2013-02-12 12:20:08] sp0cksbeard: i see. here the message is different from the title, and it's only returning the title
[2013-02-12 12:20:39] sp0cksbeard: i'm trying this on an appium checkout from github, updated this afternoon

[2013-02-12 12:45:48] toks: heh
[2013-02-12 12:46:00] toks: well... I wanted to automate some iOS testing here.... but...
[2013-02-12 12:46:14] toks: there is something happening with a required textfield in our app
[2013-02-12 12:46:18] toks: (native app)
[2013-02-12 12:46:32] toks: in that, in the simulator, when I enter the text manually... it works
[2013-02-12 12:46:49] toks: when appium does it, the app still thinks the field is empty and won't move forward
[2013-02-12 12:47:07] toks: I see no other appium api to get around this
[2013-02-12 12:47:23] sp0cksbeard: do you know if they textfield is the default text field or a custom widget?
[2013-02-12 12:47:41] toks: I find it by doing find_elements('type','UIATextField')
[2013-02-12 12:47:45] toks: returns an array of
[2013-02-12 12:47:47] toks: 1
[2013-02-12 12:48:12] sp0cksbeard: and the name/label of that field is the one you think it is?
[2013-02-12 12:48:26] sp0cksbeard: i suppose it will be, but just want to be sure
[2013-02-12 12:48:26] toks: yeah, there's only one textfield on the screen
[2013-02-12 12:48:55] toks: it's in a tablecell
[2013-02-12 12:49:11] toks: so I've tried clicking on the UIATableCell it's in
[2013-02-12 12:49:23] sp0cksbeard: what driver are you using?
[2013-02-12 12:49:29] toks: python's
[2013-02-12 12:49:58] sp0cksbeard: have you tried the "driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement", {'value': ['a', 'b',…]})?
[2013-02-12 12:50:13] sp0cksbeard: assuming the textfield is selected
[2013-02-12 12:50:14] toks: execute works in appium now?
[2013-02-12 12:50:27] sp0cksbeard: i know it works on the build i'm using

[2013-02-12 12:52:32] toks: where is that documented?
[2013-02-12 12:52:46] sp0cksbeard: i'd to look at the command.py file inside selenium package
[2013-02-12 12:53:02] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 12:53:07] sp0cksbeard: it has a list of supported commands. of course, I'd to figure out the parameter signature myself
[2013-02-12 12:53:26] sp0cksbeard: look in "selenium-2.29.0-py2.7.egg/selenium/webdriver/remote/command.py"
[2013-02-12 12:53:44] sp0cksbeard: it has a list of constants that are the various commands that "execute" will support
[2013-02-12 12:54:21] sp0cksbeard: or the version of selenium you're using, which should be the most recent hopefully
[2013-02-12 12:54:32] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 12:56:00] toks: this is epic
[2013-02-12 12:56:15] toks: thanks, there's a bunch more commands in there I didn't know about
[2013-02-12 12:56:48] toks: hey, I see getAlertText in there

[2013-02-12 13:01:08] toks: o.o
[2013-02-12 13:01:16] toks: sounds like an issue to me
[2013-02-12 13:02:08] toks: man, even dragElement is here
[2013-02-12 13:05:11] sp0cksbeard: one thing though, appium doesn't support every command from what I understand - they're working on implementing it all, but not yet there yet
[2013-02-12 13:06:11] toks: ah, yeah... I see that in the server.js logs... everytime I see 501, then I know "okay, they haven't done this yet"
[2013-02-12 13:06:50] sp0cksbeard: is any core-committer for appium here right now?
[2013-02-12 13:07:04] toks: they're not talking

[2013-02-12 13:07:31] toks: those guys are definitely on the commit list
[2013-02-12 13:10:17] sp0cksbeard: will wait till they're here to see if the current behavior of the alert is expected. unfortunately, the webdriver wire protocol only supports "alert_text", and not "alert_title". that would have made the semantics a bit clear

[2013-02-12 13:18:43] toks: yeah
[2013-02-12 13:19:00] toks: or maybe just return both and split it with nulls or something :p

[2013-02-12 13:22:18] jcarr: I think a github issue is a good place to raise that
[2013-02-12 13:22:21] sp0cksbeard: i was looking the UIAutomation javascript framework, and the "name" just says "name attribute of the elemtn"
[2013-02-12 13:24:04] sp0cksbeard: jcarr: i suspect the issue is while in the UIAutomation, the alert supports APIs for a regular element, in webdriver there are only 4 apis for that
[2013-02-12 13:24:13] sp0cksbeard: so it becomes a mapping issue
[2013-02-12 13:24:49] jcarr: then yeah github is the right place
[2013-02-12 13:24:59] jcarr: agree, by the way, with your analysis
[2013-02-12 13:25:14] sp0cksbeard: will add an issue. thanks

[2013-02-12 13:46:12] sp0cksbeard: wow. jlipps checked in a fix for that issue, although alerts still don't show up in page_source
[2013-02-12 13:50:54] toks-0xf00d: being near wholefoods is good for my diet
[2013-02-12 13:50:57] toks-0xf00d, changing nick to toks.
[2013-02-12 13:51:06] toks: (but bad for my wallet)

[2013-02-12 13:58:09] toks: so, looking at how sendKeysToActiveElement works
[2013-02-12 13:58:24] toks: it grabs the iOS keyboard, and makes it type the text
[2013-02-12 13:58:32] toks: (according to the log of server.js)
[2013-02-12 13:59:00] toks: rather that whatever magicsmoke makes UIATextField.send_keys() works
