[2013-02-06 10:59:34] sp0cksbeard: hi, is there a way to send custom UIAutomation commands to appium?
[2013-02-06 10:59:44] toks: o.O
[2013-02-06 10:59:55] sp0cksbeard: I'm trying to find a way to write to a textField inside an alert dialog
[2013-02-06 11:00:16] toks: you can't click on it, and do send_keys?
[2013-02-06 11:01:37] sp0cksbeard: I tried to switch_to_alert and then do a send_keys, but it didn't seem to work
[2013-02-06 11:02:00] toks: Hmm... I'm not sure switch_to_alert is even implemented
[2013-02-06 11:02:13] toks: if you start server.js with a -v(I think)
[2013-02-06 11:02:22] toks: you'll see how it responds to each command
[2013-02-06 11:02:26] toks: if you get "501"
[2013-02-06 11:02:32] toks: it's not implemeneted
[2013-02-06 11:03:11] sp0cksbeard: checking it outâ€¦ another question. is there a way to increase the timeout for how long the server waits for a command?
[2013-02-06 11:03:22] toks: ah :)
[2013-02-06 11:03:25] toks: I had that issue :p
[2013-02-06 11:03:33] toks: you have to patch it yourself
[2013-02-06 11:03:44] toks: lemme show ya ... hold
[2013-02-06 11:03:45] toks: on
[2013-02-06 11:04:46] toks: hmm.... I know I saw it... it's like "timeout = 60" or something
[2013-02-06 11:05:26] sp0cksbeard: checkingâ€¦ :-)
[2013-02-06 11:05:51] toks: ah https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/app/uiauto/lib/instruments_client.js
[2013-02-06 11:06:04] toks: See at the top, that = 60 thing
[2013-02-06 11:06:13] sp0cksbeard: thanks! :-)
[2013-02-06 11:06:22] toks: ^_^
[2013-02-06 11:08:08] toks: (oh, and it's node server.js --app /path/to/whatever.app -V 1 -a <IPaddr>
[2013-02-06 11:08:29] toks: so you can see if server.js actually did your command, or it just didn't work
[2013-02-06 11:08:49] toks: (it'd be nice if it responded to the webdriver with a failure...)
[2013-02-06 11:14:54] sp0cksbeard: thanks. yeah
[2013-02-06 11:20:34] sp0cksbeard: hmm. appium can't seem to find a textField inside an alert
[2013-02-06 11:20:52] sp0cksbeard: and it can't find an element with an "alert" tagname either
[2013-02-06 11:21:51] sp0cksbeard: in UIAutomation, I would override the onAlert handler to access the textField in an alert
[2013-02-06 11:21:55] toks: o.o
[2013-02-06 11:22:24] toks: if you do : driver.page_source
[2013-02-06 11:22:29] toks: you'll get a whole bunch of stuff
[2013-02-06 11:22:37] toks: is that alert anywhere in there?
[2013-02-06 11:24:29] sp0cksbeard: no
[2013-02-06 11:24:37] toks: uh oh :(
[2013-02-06 11:25:27] sp0cksbeard: the server logged a "calling onAlert"
[2013-02-06 11:25:46] sp0cksbeard: and then a "[ScriptAgent handleAlert:]: Call to onAlert returned 'YES'"
[2013-02-06 11:27:38] toks: hmm

[2013-02-06 11:41:51] toks: I'm... not sure what to think of that :p
[2013-02-06 11:42:54] toks: I wonder how that's handled with selenium-webbrowser stuff
[2013-02-06 11:43:12] toks: I know about setting up the handler for an alert before the alert actually happens...
[2013-02-06 11:43:16] toks: but typing into it?
[2013-02-06 11:43:17] toks: ....hmm
[2013-02-06 11:44:17] toks: http://aboutselenium.blogspot.com/2011/11/handling-alert-prompt-and-confirmation.html
[2013-02-06 11:45:03] toks: Maybe some crazy variant of that stuff works for iOS?

[2013-02-06 11:53:20] sp0cksbeard: also looking at the appium server code to see if it lets me send some commands over the wire
