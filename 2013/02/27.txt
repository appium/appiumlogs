[2013-02-27 10:38:46] toks: Finally, without any interaction from me... jenkins will git: pull, xcodebuild, testflightapp, fruitstrap, appium, run-tests
[2013-02-27 10:39:12] sassda: very nice!
[2013-02-27 10:39:28] toks: hardest part was apple's CodeSigning craziness

[2013-02-27 10:44:51] admc: wow, toks - you should write a blog post about how to do that!!

[2013-02-27 11:00:07] toks: sassda: yeah, real device
[2013-02-27 11:00:39] toks: there's a iphone5 with a cracked screen sitting in a closet USB-connected to the macmini that runs jenkins
[2013-02-27 11:01:08] sassda: lol, I see, so you sign the app with your dev licence and then install?
[2013-02-27 11:01:39] toks: yup
[2013-02-27 11:02:08] toks: I use xcodebuild at the commandline
[2013-02-27 11:02:18] toks: with all the args needed to sign the app properly
[2013-02-27 11:02:32] toks: and the provision file that's on that mac is the same one I've already put into the phone
[2013-02-27 11:03:04] toks: so fruitstrap can install it.... and appium can start it with: node appium -U $UUID_OF_PHONE --app com.rackspacecloud.iphone
[2013-02-27 11:03:54] sassda: can't appium take care of the install?

[2013-02-27 11:05:07] toks: requiring proper signing
[2013-02-27 11:05:16] toks: and the args to appium seem to imply that the app already be there

[2013-02-27 15:46:21] sp0cksbeard: if i want to test my app on an ios5.1 simulator but build my project using ios6.1 sdk , is that possible?
[2013-02-27 15:46:34] sp0cksbeard: i'm using xcodebuild to build my app
[2013-02-27 15:48:12] jcarr: sp0cksbeard: it's possible, but it's a pain. Basically you have to copy all the SDKs except the one you want to use out of the appropriate directory to somewhere else, then run your tests, then copy them all back. Not automated right now.
[2013-02-27 15:49:19] sp0cksbeard: hmm. i'm running into an issue where some 3rd-party tools are not compiling via xcodebuild (they're via xcode) cause they use a different compiler

[2013-02-27 16:14:50] sp0cksbeard: the modules are pulled the same way. i update cocopods, and get the workspace ready
[2013-02-27 16:16:11] sp0cksbeard: but for some reason these 3-rd party tools are using features not supported by the ios5.1 sdks
[2013-02-27 16:16:48] sp0cksbeard: i was able to get around some problems by adding stuff in precompiled headers (e.g. http://nshipster.com/ns_enum-ns_options/)
[2013-02-27 16:16:53] sp0cksbeard: but not all

[2013-02-27 16:46:27] sassda: in that case can you even compile for 5.1 in xcode? sp0cksbeard?
[2013-02-27 16:47:10] sp0cksbeard: sassda: in xcode i was using the ios6.0 sdk
[2013-02-27 16:47:33] sp0cksbeard: was thinking of doing the same for xcodebuild, but jcarr above said that that's a pain to do
[2013-02-27 16:48:05] sp0cksbeard: the pain he was referring to was for using the ios6 sdk but building for iphonesimulator5.1
[2013-02-27 16:48:20] sassda: you don't have the option of building under 5.1 in xcode?
[2013-02-27 16:53:06] sp0cksbeard: it doesn't seem to show me the option to. it doesn't even appear in the list of available sdks in base
[2013-02-27 17:04:03] sassda: that is ok, but if you look in the info of your project, you should see iOS deployement target
[2013-02-27 17:04:59] sassda: I also have only 6.1 in base SDK, but I can still run my app on 5.1 devices because I specified that deplpyment target
[2013-02-27 17:14:15] stackedsax, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-02-27 17:16:57] sp0cksbeard: sassda: that's what I do when I'm testing manually via xcode, build using 6 sdk, but using the simulator5.1 as the destination
[2013-02-27 17:18:15] sp0cksbeard: sassda: do you run tests against both isimulator 5 and 6?
[2013-02-27 17:18:22] sassda: yes
[2013-02-27 17:18:49] sp0cksbeard: can you share some insight on how you manage automating those tests?
[2013-02-27 17:18:56] sp0cksbeard: do you build using xcodebuild?
[2013-02-27 17:19:45] sp0cksbeard: how do you tell appium which simulator to use?
[2013-02-27 17:20:01] sp0cksbeard: using desired_capabilities?
[2013-02-27 17:21:01] sassda: lemme check
[2013-02-27 17:21:37] sp0cksbeard: thanks
[2013-02-27 17:27:45] sassda: oh, so our old tests on UIA can be run on 5.1 and 6.1, but the appium tests are running on 6.1, changing the capabilities doesn't do anything, weird
[2013-02-27 17:27:50] sassda: sorry for the fake hope
[2013-02-27 17:28:40] sp0cksbeard: sassda: np :-). i was able to compile a version with ios5.1. now trying to figure out how to run multiple versions of the simulators at the same time
[2013-02-27 17:28:57] sp0cksbeard: or at least make appium launch the desired one
[2013-02-27 17:29:09] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: any clues? ^ :-)
[2013-02-27 17:29:45] sp0cksbeard: to summarize: how can I tell appium to launch a specific version of the ios simulator (5.1 or 6.1)?
[2013-02-27 17:29:54] jlipps: yeah sp0cksbeard it's a known issue that instruments always launches latest version of simulator
[2013-02-27 17:30:06] sp0cksbeard: i see
[2013-02-27 17:30:13] jlipps: i think the only way around it is moving SDKs out of directories so that instruments doesn't think they exist
[2013-02-27 17:30:23] jlipps: i.e., fake-delete 6.1 for the duration of the test so instruments uses 5.1
[2013-02-27 17:30:26] jlipps: at least that's what i've heard
[2013-02-27 17:30:32] sp0cksbeard: ok
[2013-02-27 17:30:33] sassda: woh
[2013-02-27 17:30:34] jlipps: we want to find a way to automate this in appium so we don't need to do this
[2013-02-27 17:30:54] sp0cksbeard: it would be great if you could do this using the desired capabilites specs
[2013-02-27 17:30:55] jlipps: but haven't got around to it yet. let us know if you find another less dramatic way of doing this, outside of appium even!
[2013-02-27 17:31:04] sp0cksbeard: definitely!
[2013-02-27 17:31:05] jlipps: once we can do it reliably somehow, we'll build it into desired caps
