[2013-02-11 14:15:47] toks: ya know, what do I need to do to make npm just install all dependencies
[2013-02-11 14:16:03] toks: I keep trying to start: node server.js
[2013-02-11 14:16:08] toks: I get an error about a missing module

[2013-02-11 14:18:15] jlipps: if you're in the appium directory, it'll install all the things
[2013-02-11 14:18:31] jlipps: and it's no biggie to rm -rf node_modules/
[2013-02-11 14:18:38] jlipps: and redo "npm install"

[2013-02-11 14:19:08] jlipps: also, if you're not getting responses on here, there's a discussion list, or feel free to create an issue on github
[2013-02-11 14:19:18] sourishkrout: jlipps is right about the dependencies. npm install ‚Äîsave is for any custom dependencies you wanna make sticky
[2013-02-11 14:19:38] nags: jlipps, sure, will do that in future :-)
[2013-02-11 14:19:59] jlipps: nags: here's another thing you can do:
[2013-02-11 14:20:08] nags: jlipps, sure
[2013-02-11 14:20:18] jlipps: run the commands in two separate terminal processes, and without the &
[2013-02-11 14:20:25] nags: ok
[2013-02-11 14:20:26] jlipps: so in one, type this: "appium -V 1"
[2013-02-11 14:20:31] jlipps: and wait for it to start
[2013-02-11 14:20:39] jlipps: or to say that it's listening
[2013-02-11 14:20:46] jlipps: and then run the test command in the other terminal
[2013-02-11 14:20:47] *nags doing the commands suggested by jlipps '
[2013-02-11 14:20:59] jlipps: with the verbose flag on, you'll be able to see what the appium server is trying to do
[2013-02-11 14:22:26] nags: jlipps, http://pastebin.com/Spj8Bu3Q
[2013-02-11 14:23:32] jlipps: can you try with a capital "V" for me?
[2013-02-11 14:23:40] jlipps: and at least i can now see what the exception is :-)
[2013-02-11 14:24:31] jlipps: nags ^^
[2013-02-11 14:24:53] nags: jlipps, http://pastebin.com/T7r9eq86
[2013-02-11 14:25:28] jlipps: lol, let's try one more time: "appium -V 1" (the 1 is also necessary, unintuitive I know)
[2013-02-11 14:25:45] nags: jlipps, sure
[2013-02-11 14:26:01] nags: jlipps, same error message
[2013-02-11 14:26:03] jlipps: also, if the problem persists, can i convince you to checkout the github repo
[2013-02-11 14:26:15] nags: jlipps, sure
[2013-02-11 14:26:16] jlipps: it could be something is weird in the version we published to npm
[2013-02-11 14:26:41] toks: hmm... so if the OSX screen is locked... I can't use appium?

[2013-02-11 14:27:04] nags: jI guessed that, let me try now
[2013-02-11 14:27:39] jlipps: toks interesting, i haven't got my device set up for to explore that
[2013-02-11 14:28:00] toks: I'm guessing that's the issue
[2013-02-11 14:28:05] toks: I'm doing this to a remote macmini
[2013-02-11 14:28:11] toks: I have no idea what state it's in :p
[2013-02-11 14:28:31] toks: I'm guessing it's locked
[2013-02-11 14:28:51] jlipps: is there an actual device attached to the remote macmini or a sim?
[2013-02-11 14:29:01] toks: sim

[2013-02-11 14:29:58] toks: o.o
[2013-02-11 14:30:02] jlipps: nags, are you in the directory where you cloned the repo?
[2013-02-11 14:30:38] jlipps: seems to think it can't find package.json which is in the root of the codebase
[2013-02-11 14:30:42] nags: jlipps, I haven't clone appium yet
[2013-02-11 14:30:51] nags: jlipps, could this be an issue http://pastebin.com/yUJtFUH7
[2013-02-11 14:30:54] jlipps: ah yes, clone first then go through those steps
[2013-02-11 14:31:01] nags: jlipps, sorry
[2013-02-11 14:31:05] nags: let me do it now
[2013-02-11 14:31:16] jlipps: the npm install xxxx -g should be ok
[2013-02-11 14:31:20] jlipps: they can run before or after
[2013-02-11 14:31:27] jlipps: but "npm install" has to happen in the cloned dir
[2013-02-11 14:31:46] jlipps: it's basically saying "install all the dependencies for this project, which i'll find in ./package.json"
[2013-02-11 14:32:06] jlipps: the -g flag is saying "install this package globally", so it doesn't care whether there's a package.json
[2013-02-11 14:32:20] nags: jlipps, ok

[2013-02-11 14:34:59] jlipps: weird!
[2013-02-11 14:35:11] jlipps: can you do npm -v and node -v

[2013-02-11 14:36:30] admc: i think we need to say appium has minimum .8 version

[2013-02-11 15:08:18] jlipps: ok let me try something
[2013-02-11 15:08:25] nags: jlipps, sure :-) thanks
[2013-02-11 15:10:32] nags: jlipps, BTW, I'm author of http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/Home just incase ;-)
[2013-02-11 15:20:53] jlipps: nags after thinking it through i'm not sure how this will be possible. but i don't have an app on hand that fires up another app. i believe if i did you'd still be able to click around the other app, but i don't think at that point that you could tell uiautomation to switch back to the first app.
[2013-02-11 15:21:36] nags: jlipps, ok, so looks like this is not possible
[2013-02-11 15:21:55] jlipps: it might be possible but i can't think of a way offhand
[2013-02-11 15:22:01] jlipps: what is your use case for this?
[2013-02-11 15:23:01] nags: jlipps, I work with VMware, they are developing a product, which will do the above task I mentioned
[2013-02-11 15:24:29] toks: man... wanna see the gnarly command I had to run to remotely enable VNCserver on OSX so I could use vncviewer from linux? :D

[2013-02-11 15:25:19] nags: jlipps, maybe launching settings app from your test app is also a scenario
[2013-02-11 15:31:30] jlipps: nags, i see. yeah, can't think of a way to get back to the first app once you've navigated away. but the phone should remember settings. so the next appium session should be able to check for those, so you could do it in a 2-part process
[2013-02-11 15:31:39] jlipps: yikes toks!
[2013-02-11 15:32:07] nags: jlipps, ok

[2013-02-11 15:33:46] toks: okay
[2013-02-11 15:33:47] toks: so verified
[2013-02-11 15:33:58] toks: I had to vnc into the mac and lgoin
[2013-02-11 15:34:01] toks: login*
[2013-02-11 15:34:13] toks: so that driver = webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:4723/wd/hub",{})
[2013-02-11 15:34:16] toks: would work
[2013-02-11 15:34:24] jlipps: oh gotcha
[2013-02-11 15:34:27] jlipps: well that's useful
[2013-02-11 15:34:30] toks: :)
[2013-02-11 15:45:57] toks: hmm
[2013-02-11 15:46:09] toks: webelement.text broken again
[2013-02-11 15:46:23] toks: at least, from npm install appium
[2013-02-11 15:46:33] toks: I dunno if that's updated to current github mater
[2013-02-11 15:48:02] rodericj: ?
[2013-02-11 15:48:29] toks: driver.find_elements("whatever","UIATableCell")[2].text
[2013-02-11 15:48:35] toks: is a string of 0 length
[2013-02-11 15:48:54] toks: but server.js logs clearly show...
[2013-02-11 15:48:55] toks: info: [INST] 2013-02-11 23:48:20 +0000 Default: Lookup returned [object UIATableCell] with the name "OpenStack, Custom API Configuration" (id: 29).
[2013-02-11 15:49:09] toks: that text in quotes is what I want the .text property to give me
[2013-02-11 15:49:32] toks: I put "whatever" there, cuz it doesn't appear to matter to appium what that value is
[2013-02-11 15:51:03] toks: yeah...
[2013-02-11 15:51:13] toks: that was broken before... then fixed.... now broken again
[2013-02-11 15:51:28] toks: (assuming npm install appium == git clone appium-master)

[2013-02-11 16:37:35] toks: you have to drag the sim around before its screen updates
[2013-02-11 16:50:14] sourishkrout: toks ^^ my comment for /text is still valid
[2013-02-11 16:50:15] sourishkrout: https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/66
[2013-02-11 16:50:31] sourishkrout: i.e. "OpenStack, Custom API Configuration" is the name of the button
[2013-02-11 16:50:35] sourishkrout: and not it's value
[2013-02-11 16:50:59] sourishkrout: appium will have to handle this type specific
[2013-02-11 16:51:07] sourishkrout: haven't gotten around to look at it though
[2013-02-11 16:51:51] sourishkrout: (unless someone else took a stab at it)
[2013-02-11 16:53:00] sourishkrout: also, not to confuse with the way it works when working with a web view

[2013-02-11 18:14:16] toks: heh
[2013-02-11 18:14:24] toks: oh, an interesting issue has come up for me
[2013-02-11 18:14:34] toks: I have a field that is required in my app
[2013-02-11 18:14:55] toks: when I do find_element('type','UIATextField').send_keys('helloworld')
[2013-02-11 18:15:02] toks: it fills it with the text
[2013-02-11 18:15:22] toks: but when I click on save, it gives an alert indicating it's blank
[2013-02-11 18:15:34] toks: when I do it on the sim manually, it works
[2013-02-11 18:16:10] toks: I'm thinking some kind of "focus" event isn't happening that let's the UI know I did what I needed to do
