[2013-02-04 10:50:29] toks: o.o
[2013-02-04 10:58:35] skatterbean: toks: looks like in mechanic.js there is a tap function that calls UIATarget's tapWithOptions
[2013-02-04 10:59:08] toks: o.o
[2013-02-04 10:59:26] skatterbean: toks: mechanic.js line 416
[2013-02-04 10:59:46] skatterbean: toks: which calls http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Reference/UIATargetClassReference/UIATargetClass/UIATargetClass.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009924
[2013-02-04 11:00:09] toks: can it let me tap an arbitrary point on the screen? In general, if I have to actually give an element as an argument ....it'll crash appium
[2013-02-04 11:00:14] toks: cuz it's "out of focus"
[2013-02-04 11:00:17] toks: but, I'll try it
[2013-02-04 11:01:01] skatterbean: tapWithOptions, you can send it a js object with x and y keys
[2013-02-04 11:01:14] toks: o_O
[2013-02-04 11:01:16] toks: hmm
[2013-02-04 11:01:21] toks: okay... here I go then!
[2013-02-04 11:01:27] skatterbean: toks: look at that link in the apple doc
[2013-02-04 11:01:38] skatterbean: the first arg is a tapPointObject
[2013-02-04 11:02:22] skatterbean: so you'd send {x:x_coord, y:y_coord}
[2013-02-04 11:02:25] toks: ooooooohhhhhhh, yeah I'm sure the UIAutomator has all the stuff needed... I just don't think appium has "mapped" that function to a selenium method
[2013-02-04 11:02:30] toks: but let me double-check
[2013-02-04 11:02:57] skatterbean: toks: I'm looking at the appium source, that's how I found this
[2013-02-04 11:03:05] toks: D:
[2013-02-04 11:08:04] jcarr, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-04 11:14:31] toks: skatterbean: ok. rocking
[2013-02-04 11:14:39] toks: Needed a git pull and some more nodejs modules
[2013-02-04 11:20:13] skatterbean: toks: from selenium.webdriver.common.touch_actions import TouchActions
[2013-02-04 11:26:11] toks: good times :)
[2013-02-04 11:26:21] skatterbean: wait toks
[2013-02-04 11:31:28] toks: 501 Not implemented :(
[2013-02-04 11:32:50] toks: TouchActions(driver).tap_and_hold(dict(x=160.0,y=50.0),1).release(dict(x-160.0,y=50.0),1).perform()
[2013-02-04 11:33:03] toks: (note, I completely made up that "1" argument)
[2013-02-04 11:33:10] toks: I have no idea what's suppose to be there
[2013-02-04 11:33:18] toks: lemme double-check :p
[2013-02-04 11:33:47] toks: ooooohhhh
[2013-02-04 11:33:54] toks: tap_and_hold(self, x, y)
[2013-02-04 11:34:09] toks: retrying(but if it's not implemented,... probably will be the same)
[2013-02-04 11:35:05] toks: yeah, still 501
[2013-02-04 11:37:03] toks: Ah, https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/app/routing.js
[2013-02-04 11:37:18] toks: So I guess this is the complete list of what is implemented.
[2013-02-04 11:37:50] jcarr: toks, that's /session/:sessionId/touch/down I think
[2013-02-04 11:37:56] toks: yup
[2013-02-04 11:38:00] toks: looking at the logs
[2013-02-04 11:38:06] toks: it's /touch/up|down
[2013-02-04 11:38:15] jcarr: I have no idea why I called that 'tap_and_hold'
[2013-02-04 11:38:16] toks: and it's not in routing.js
[2013-02-04 11:38:19] toks: :p
[2013-02-04 11:38:24] jcarr: but I guess that's technically what it does
[2013-02-04 11:38:32] jcarr: should be 'touch_down'
[2013-02-04 11:38:36] jcarr: I might even submit that
[2013-02-04 11:38:43] toks: agreed :)
[2013-02-04 11:38:54] toks: well...actually
[2013-02-04 11:39:10] toks: tap_and_hold == keydown ....it could make sense on a touch screen
[2013-02-04 11:39:11] skatterbean: jcarr: yeah, we're looking for ways to dismiss the detail view of a UISplitViewController
[2013-02-04 11:39:13] skatterbean: which just needs a tap
[2013-02-04 11:40:11] jcarr: and click doesn't work/
[2013-02-04 11:40:13] jcarr: ?
[2013-02-04 11:40:43] toks: can I click on an arbitrary x,y?
[2013-02-04 11:40:55] toks: if it's an element, it doesn't seem to work...
[2013-02-04 11:41:23] toks: (and fyi, driver.orientation crashes appium)
[2013-02-04 11:42:24] jcarr: ahh
[2013-02-04 11:43:15] sourishkrout, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-02-04 11:44:09] jcarr: yeah there's not a good way to tap generic x, y coords right now
[2013-02-04 11:45:24] toks: skatterbean pointed me to this http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Reference/UIATargetClassReference/UIATargetClass/UIATargetClass.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009924
[2013-02-04 11:45:49] toks: so I guess, if we can... we should attempt to implement that event and add it to appium's routing.js
[2013-02-04 11:45:56] skatterbean: jcarr: it looks like there's some facility in mechanic.js to tap?
[2013-02-04 11:46:18] skatterbean: oh, right, mechanic isn't appium really
[2013-02-04 11:51:20] jcarr: yeah it's possible in uiautomation, I think

[2013-02-04 13:14:38] jlipps: skatterbean, toks: appium uses mechanic under the hood
[2013-02-04 13:14:45] jlipps: anything that's possible with it is possible with appium
[2013-02-04 13:15:04] jlipps: in fact there's a "au" object (which is what appium uses to make things happen in UIAutomation-land)
[2013-02-04 13:15:08] skatterbean: jlipps: that's what I realized, just what were wanting to do isn't wired up in routing.js
[2013-02-04 13:15:09] jlipps: and it just extends mechanic's $
[2013-02-04 13:15:50] jlipps: yeah. "wiring up X in routing.js" is a non-trivial thing though, not technically but because we're trying to keep parity with the JSON wire protocol. what are you after exactly?
[2013-02-04 13:16:01] *jlipps scrolls up'
[2013-02-04 13:16:21] jlipps: yeah there's a discussion going on on the appium-discuss list right now about the best way to handle device-specific functionality like this
[2013-02-04 13:17:30] jlipps: i think sourishkrout is in the process of implementing a framework for accessing these kinds of capabilities via execute_script
[2013-02-04 13:19:27] sourishkrout: yep, that's on my list of things to do
