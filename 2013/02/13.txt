[2013-02-13 10:28:43] jlipps: sassda: you are totally right about the keyboard accepting "\n" as whatever the action button is
[2013-02-13 10:29:04] jlipps: the trouble was that selenium turns "\n" into "\uE008"
[2013-02-13 10:29:16] jlipps: so all i have to do us turn it back into "\n" on the instruments side, and we're golden

[2013-02-13 10:57:14] jlipps: sfbrian: #177 should fix your issue when it gets merged
[2013-02-13 10:57:30] sfbrian: jlipps: nice! thanks dude
[2013-02-13 10:58:14] sfbrian: so just send_keys("\n") will submit the form?
[2013-02-13 10:58:29] jlipps: well in python there's the additional wrinkle that send_keys is really POST /value
[2013-02-13 10:58:39] jlipps: and that should still work

[2013-02-13 10:58:47] jlipps: but we're waiting on a patch from gaige to make that happen
[2013-02-13 10:59:06] jlipps: meanwhile, if you use that weird driver.execute(somecrazycommand) thing i pasted yesterday, it'll work
[2013-02-13 10:59:08] sfbrian: so you still have to do SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT?
[2013-02-13 10:59:15] sfbrian: yeah
[2013-02-13 10:59:26] jlipps: yes, but you can do "\n" and not "\\uE007"
[2013-02-13 10:59:37] sfbrian: nice
[2013-02-13 10:59:53] jlipps: and in a bit you'll be able to do send_keys as well
[2013-02-13 11:00:17] sfbrian: sounds good

[2013-02-13 11:17:25] sfbrian: jlipps: looking at your code. I noticed that "\\n" works as a temp solution
[2013-02-13 11:20:01] jlipps: yes, although it won't work once you pull
