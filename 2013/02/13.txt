[2013-02-13 10:28:43] jlipps: sassda: you are totally right about the keyboard accepting "\n" as whatever the action button is
[2013-02-13 10:29:04] jlipps: the trouble was that selenium turns "\n" into "\uE008"
[2013-02-13 10:29:16] jlipps: so all i have to do us turn it back into "\n" on the instruments side, and we're golden

[2013-02-13 10:57:30] sfbrian: jlipps: nice! thanks dude
[2013-02-13 10:58:14] sfbrian: so just send_keys("\n") will submit the form?
[2013-02-13 10:58:29] jlipps: well in python there's the additional wrinkle that send_keys is really POST /value
[2013-02-13 10:58:39] jlipps: and that should still work

[2013-02-13 10:58:47] jlipps: but we're waiting on a patch from gaige to make that happen
[2013-02-13 10:59:06] jlipps: meanwhile, if you use that weird driver.execute(somecrazycommand) thing i pasted yesterday, it'll work
[2013-02-13 10:59:08] sfbrian: so you still have to do SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT?
[2013-02-13 10:59:15] sfbrian: yeah
[2013-02-13 10:59:26] jlipps: yes, but you can do "\n" and not "\\uE007"
[2013-02-13 10:59:37] sfbrian: nice
[2013-02-13 10:59:53] jlipps: and in a bit you'll be able to do send_keys as well

[2013-02-13 11:17:25] sfbrian: jlipps: looking at your code. I noticed that "\\n" works as a temp solution
[2013-02-13 11:20:01] jlipps: yes, although it won't work once you pull
[2013-02-13 11:20:05] jlipps: since i added some escaping
[2013-02-13 11:25:25] jlipps: sfbrian: do you have the SEND_KEYS_TOâ€¦ command at hand? i forgot it and want to post it on the mailing list

[2013-02-13 11:32:28] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: are you familiar with appium related stuff on saucelabs? I was trying to test an app with saucelabs, and I get a "Failed to download mobile app" error
[2013-02-13 11:32:50] sp0cksbeard: trying to figure out if it's because the app might be too large in size
[2013-02-13 11:33:20] sp0cksbeard: i can test the same app on a local appium server just fine
[2013-02-13 11:33:26] toks: o.o
[2013-02-13 11:33:48] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: i am familiar in that i helped build it :-) so let's figure it out
[2013-02-13 11:33:54] toks: ha
[2013-02-13 11:33:58] toks: I was just typing that
[2013-02-13 11:33:59] sp0cksbeard: cool! :-)
[2013-02-13 11:34:48] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: when did you try to run this test? just now?
[2013-02-13 11:35:32] sp0cksbeard: no. around 12:22 pm. I can run it again
[2013-02-13 11:35:46] jlipps: yeah i just deployed a newer version of appium about an hour ago
[2013-02-13 11:35:53] jlipps: see if the same thing happens
[2013-02-13 11:35:59] jlipps: brb
[2013-02-13 11:36:12] sp0cksbeard: ooh. does saucelabs expect a zip?
[2013-02-13 11:36:41] sp0cksbeard: i passed the path to the uncompressed version. may be that's the reason?
[2013-02-13 11:36:47] sp0cksbeard: trying again after compressing
[2013-02-13 11:37:22] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: yes try that, also can you give me the url of the job that failed? i can take a look at the logs
[2013-02-13 11:37:26] jlipps: but we do expect a zip
[2013-02-13 11:37:48] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: sending it in a private channel
[2013-02-13 11:37:54] jlipps: k
[2013-02-13 11:39:04] sassda1, changing nick to sassda.
[2013-02-13 11:39:28] jlipps: ah
[2013-02-13 11:39:41] jlipps: another issue sp0cksbeard is that the zip has to be hosted on a URL accessible publicly or via sauce connect
[2013-02-13 11:39:48] jlipps: we unfortunately don't have access to your filesystem :-)
[2013-02-13 11:40:03] sp0cksbeard: ah. of course! :-)
[2013-02-13 11:40:11] jlipps: so the 'app' desiredCap has to be (a) URL and (b) zip
[2013-02-13 11:40:17] sp0cksbeard: i tried with sauce-connect too, but it was without the compressed version
[2013-02-13 11:40:44] sp0cksbeard: nm. missed the "URL" part
[2013-02-13 11:41:01] sp0cksbeard: thanks!
[2013-02-13 11:41:06] jlipps: (even with sauce connect, it has to be a url--sauce connect is just a proxy, not reverse ssh or something)
[2013-02-13 11:41:27] jlipps: yep np let me know how it goes
[2013-02-13 11:42:20] sourishkrout: there's a #saucelabs channel btw for sauce related stuff
