[2013-02-13 10:29:04] jlipps: the trouble was that selenium turns "\n" into "\uE008"
[2013-02-13 10:29:16] jlipps: so all i have to do us turn it back into "\n" on the instruments side, and we're golden

[2013-02-13 10:58:14] sfbrian: so just send_keys("\n") will submit the form?
[2013-02-13 10:58:29] jlipps: well in python there's the additional wrinkle that send_keys is really POST /value
[2013-02-13 10:58:39] jlipps: and that should still work

[2013-02-13 10:59:06] jlipps: meanwhile, if you use that weird driver.execute(somecrazycommand) thing i pasted yesterday, it'll work
[2013-02-13 10:59:08] sfbrian: so you still have to do SEND_KEYS_TO_ACTIVE_ELEMENT?
[2013-02-13 10:59:15] sfbrian: yeah
[2013-02-13 10:59:26] jlipps: yes, but you can do "\n" and not "\\uE007"
[2013-02-13 10:59:37] sfbrian: nice
[2013-02-13 10:59:53] jlipps: and in a bit you'll be able to do send_keys as well

[2013-02-13 11:32:28] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: are you familiar with appium related stuff on saucelabs? I was trying to test an app with saucelabs, and I get a "Failed to download mobile app" error
[2013-02-13 11:32:50] sp0cksbeard: trying to figure out if it's because the app might be too large in size
[2013-02-13 11:33:20] sp0cksbeard: i can test the same app on a local appium server just fine
[2013-02-13 11:33:26] toks: o.o
[2013-02-13 11:33:48] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: i am familiar in that i helped build it :-) so let's figure it out
[2013-02-13 11:33:54] toks: ha
[2013-02-13 11:33:58] toks: I was just typing that
[2013-02-13 11:33:59] sp0cksbeard: cool! :-)
[2013-02-13 11:34:48] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: when did you try to run this test? just now?
[2013-02-13 11:35:32] sp0cksbeard: no. around 12:22 pm. I can run it again
[2013-02-13 11:35:46] jlipps: yeah i just deployed a newer version of appium about an hour ago
[2013-02-13 11:35:53] jlipps: see if the same thing happens
[2013-02-13 11:35:59] jlipps: brb
[2013-02-13 11:36:12] sp0cksbeard: ooh. does saucelabs expect a zip?
[2013-02-13 11:36:41] sp0cksbeard: i passed the path to the uncompressed version. may be that's the reason?
[2013-02-13 11:36:47] sp0cksbeard: trying again after compressing
[2013-02-13 11:37:22] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: yes try that, also can you give me the url of the job that failed? i can take a look at the logs
[2013-02-13 11:37:26] jlipps: but we do expect a zip
[2013-02-13 11:37:48] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: sending it in a private channel
[2013-02-13 11:37:54] jlipps: k
[2013-02-13 11:39:04] sassda1, changing nick to sassda.
[2013-02-13 11:39:28] jlipps: ah
[2013-02-13 11:39:41] jlipps: another issue sp0cksbeard is that the zip has to be hosted on a URL accessible publicly or via sauce connect
[2013-02-13 11:39:48] jlipps: we unfortunately don't have access to your filesystem :-)
[2013-02-13 11:40:03] sp0cksbeard: ah. of course! :-)
[2013-02-13 11:40:11] jlipps: so the 'app' desiredCap has to be (a) URL and (b) zip
[2013-02-13 11:40:17] sp0cksbeard: i tried with sauce-connect too, but it was without the compressed version
[2013-02-13 11:40:44] sp0cksbeard: nm. missed the "URL" part
[2013-02-13 11:41:01] sp0cksbeard: thanks!
[2013-02-13 11:41:06] jlipps: (even with sauce connect, it has to be a url--sauce connect is just a proxy, not reverse ssh or something)
[2013-02-13 11:41:27] jlipps: yep np let me know how it goes
[2013-02-13 11:42:20] sourishkrout: there's a #saucelabs channel btw for sauce related stuff

[2013-02-13 14:24:08] jlipps: toks maybe you'd be good to ask about this
[2013-02-13 14:24:21] jlipps: we've gone back and forth about whether to return value(), label(), or name() for button.text
[2013-02-13 14:24:33] jlipps: it seems like there's no consistency about which is there
[2013-02-13 14:24:42] jlipps: it's probably broken because i switched it from value() to label() yesterday
[2013-02-13 14:25:03] jlipps: but maybe we need a priority cascade of checks instead
[2013-02-13 14:25:24] jlipps: to test, you could change button.text to button.attribute('value')
[2013-02-13 14:25:34] jlipps: (or whatever the right code is) to see if your text comes back that way
[2013-02-13 14:25:56] jlipps: if so, can you create an issue on github so we can track progress of fixing this?
[2013-02-13 14:28:39] sp0cksbeard: jlipps: can we execute arbitrary UIAutomation javascript commands via driver.execute?
[2013-02-13 14:29:04] jlipps: sp0cksbeard: yes but this is for dev purposes only. we're working on writing to the appium-discuss list about this
[2013-02-13 14:29:24] sp0cksbeard: i see
[2013-02-13 14:29:42] jlipps: ideally, when you run into something that you feel you need raw UIAutomation for, create an issue on github so we can tackle it, and make it nice and WebDrivery
[2013-02-13 14:29:57] sp0cksbeard: you mentioned examples of that before on IRC. were you referring to the "execute.js"?
[2013-02-13 14:30:43] jlipps: yes sp0cksbeard the first few tests in execute.js are of that. the next tests are for running javascript in a webview
[2013-02-13 14:30:45] jlipps: brb
[2013-02-13 14:30:54] sp0cksbeard: thanks

[2013-02-13 15:31:50] toks: oh, and I'm filing an issue that UIAElement.text is broken
[2013-02-13 15:32:11] *toks verifies with current git'
[2013-02-13 15:32:17] *toks ..git pull'

[2013-02-13 15:49:25] toks: okay
[2013-02-13 15:49:31] toks: yeah, text is broken for tablecell
[2013-02-13 15:50:10] toks: server.js log says Look up returned [object UIATableCell] with the name "Rackspace blahblah, servername"
[2013-02-13 15:50:49] toks: so I'd expect that driver.find_element_by_tag_name('UIATableCell').name would give me that same string
[2013-02-13 15:51:01] toks: .name not define for tablecell
[2013-02-13 15:51:11] toks: and .text is string of length 0
[2013-02-13 15:54:42] jlipps: toks i believe that's a known issue with tablecells. i guess tablecell elements get refreshed very quickly, so between the time you select one from webdriver and the time you try to get its name (or tap on it) the element no longer exists according to UIAuto
[2013-02-13 15:55:04] toks: hmm
[2013-02-13 15:55:25] toks: this UI is not moving though
[2013-02-13 15:55:28] jlipps: so we're going to need to implement some kind of chaining mechanism where it seems like you're getting the element and clicking in two steps but it's actually one on the server side
[2013-02-13 15:55:56] toks: does this apply even if I haven't click on anything yet
[2013-02-13 15:55:59] jlipps: basically UIAuto is releasing references to the js elements, but the app element isn't changing
[2013-02-13 15:56:11] toks: oh

[2013-02-13 15:56:39] jlipps: like i bet if you did driver.execute(au.getElementByTag('UIATableCell').name()) it would work
[2013-02-13 15:56:47] toks: o.o
[2013-02-13 15:56:51] stackedsax, joining. (#appium)
[2013-02-13 15:56:52] toks: good enough for me!
[2013-02-13 15:56:55] jlipps: (with the inner part in quotes)
[2013-02-13 15:56:57] *toks tries that out'
[2013-02-13 15:57:01] toks: right
[2013-02-13 15:57:02] jlipps: but…. we are deprecating driver.execute for UIAutomation
[2013-02-13 15:57:08] toks: .....
[2013-02-13 15:57:14] toks:  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[2013-02-13 15:57:17] jlipps: it's a nice thing to have for devving on appium
[2013-02-13 15:57:23] jlipps: but we don't want users to write tests with it
[2013-02-13 15:57:36] jlipps: so do it for now but we'll come up with a nice webdriver way to get around this problem
[2013-02-13 15:57:46] toks: hmm
[2013-02-13 15:58:10] toks: well, before you remove it completely please have a workaround for: driver.execute("sendKeysToActiveElement",{'value':list(newname)})
[2013-02-13 15:58:27] jlipps: we're not going to remove it completely (see forthcoming email to appium-discuss)
[2013-02-13 15:58:35] toks: ah
[2013-02-13 15:58:39] jlipps: just make it an opt-in thing that generates warnings
[2013-02-13 15:59:05] toks: cool... maybe label it driver.super_unsafe_unsupported_deprecated_execute()
[2013-02-13 15:59:11] jlipps: toks what language are you using
[2013-02-13 15:59:16] toks: py :)

[2013-02-13 16:14:44] toks: and yet, driver.find_element_by_name('some text').name is undefined
[2013-02-13 16:14:49] toks: which seems odd
